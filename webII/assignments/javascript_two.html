        <p>In this next step, we will be learning about:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Variables</li>
        <li>Variable Types</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Within a javascript file, create an example of a number variable, a string variable, an expression, an array, and an object.</li>
        <li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The most simple building block of any language is the variable. Understanding them is essential for moving forward in programming.</p>
        <p>Note: In general with most errors, if you copy the stack trace and put it in google you can most often reason your way out of it.</p>
        <p>Save the html file containing the javascript as: '1_4.js'.</p>

        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math"><em>Assignment 5</em></a></p>
        <p>In this next step, we will be learning about:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Operators (Comparison, Increment)</li>
        <li>Simple Math</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Math is used often in programming, so it's details are useful to know. Regardless of your opinion of it, it is the cornerstone of the calculation based processes that run our world.</p>
        <p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Create a text element that changes it's text back and forth based on a boolean variable triggered by a button click.</li>
        <li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Save the file(s) with the prefix '1_5'.</p>

        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings"><em>Assignment 6</em></a></p>
        <p>In this next step, we will be learning about:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Strings!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Strings are what text is called in programming. This is the essential technology that we use to communicate, and the web is a largely text-based medium. Therefore it is truly essential that we have control over the words within this system. Almost all programs use text in some form.</p>
        <p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Create an input dialog that asks for your favorite color and returns 'my favorite color is blue as well!' if the response returned is the string 'blue'.</li>
        <li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Save the file(s) with the prefix '1_6'.</p>
