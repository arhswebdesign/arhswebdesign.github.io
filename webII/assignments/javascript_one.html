        <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. It is used to make dynamic webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is more difficult to learn than other Web Fundamentals such as HTML and CSS, because it is truly a programming language, but your understanding of HTML and CSS will sure help.</p>
        <p>Click on the link below and read the page. Work the example in replit, using index.html and, when asked to script.js</p>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript"><em>Assignment 1</em></a></p>
        <p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Please create an html page with a button showing text saying some text other than what is provided.</li>
        <li>Make it so that when you click this button, a heading appears underneath the button saying some other text other than what was added above.</li>
        <li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: This should be similar to the example code, just with some simple modifications and the comments put in your own words.</p>
        <p>When you've done that, copy the index.html file to a new file, '1_1.html' and copy the javascript file to a new file, '1_1.js'. </p>
        <p>Then delete the contents of index.html and script.js, to get ready for assignment 2.</p>
        <p>After you complete both assignments, you will submit the repl.</p>

        <p>By this time you should have a good understanding of JS theory as well as simple idea of how it can interact with html.</p>
        <p>In this next step, we will be learning about:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>More examples of JS code</li>
        <li>How to think about problems</li>
        <li>Events</li>
        <li>Loops</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This page may seem somewhat long, but it provides really essential content to learn javascript. When you have finished you will have a good grasp on the simple technical aspects of JS necessary to start building more feature-filled applications.</p>
        <p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Please build the game that the instructions provide.</li>
        <li>Style the paragraph in whatever capacity you like</li>
        <li>Change the values to display what you would like.</li>
        <li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">Developer Tools</a> are useful here. In short, developer tools allow you to inspect the DOM provided by whichever webpage you are accessing the content of. They also have an integrated console that responds with errors if the code that you provide to it is incorrect, and a debugger to step through your code to understand where it is proceeding incorrectly. It also provides an integrated javascript shell to interact with to test small functions.<br />To access this feature, you can "open in a new tab", then right click on the webpage and select 'inspect'. You can also type 'Ctrl+Shift+I' on windows, or 'Command+Option+I' on Mac to immediately open the tools.</p>
        <p>When done, you can leave your finished work in index.html. Then submit.</p>
