        <h3>Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. <br>
        </h3>
        <p>The Bootstrap framework is perhaps the most popular tool for RWD.</p>
            
        <p>Go to W3schools and read <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp">the RWD introduction. </a> <br/>Continue to click the "Next" button. Read through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>RWD Intro</li>
            <li>RWD Viewport</li>
            <li>RWD Grid View</li>
            <li>RWD Media Queries</li>
            <li>RWD Images</li>
            <li>RWD Videos</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Start reading the next section (RWD Frameworks), but skip the first part about Using W3.CSS. Start reading again at the large heading that says "Bootstrap."
            When finished, you'll see "To learn more about Bootstrap, go to our Bootstrap Tutorial." Click on that. Read just the following two sections. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>BS Grid Basic</li>
            <li>BS Templates (in the section called Bootstrap Themes)</li>
        </ul>
          <p>  
              Look at the different templates and themes.  Do at least 2 of the "Try-it" links and see what happens when you resize the window in each case.
          </p>
          <p>
              One of the problems with understanding what's going on is that it uses css from " bootstrap.min.css " via a link statement. But that is public, too.  So we can examine it.
          </p>
          <p>
              Navigate to <a href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css</a> 
              and look at the file.
          </p>
          <p>
              Search the sheet (Try using "find" on the window) for @media.  You can see that bootstrap uses media queries.  What are the four break points? 
          </p>
          <p>
              You are to make your final web site responsive.  All aspects of the site should look good both one phones and on desktops. So, for this assignment, you will start by creating a small responsive site from a template.
          </p>
          <p>
              Begin with the "collapsing columns" type of responsiveness shown in the first Bootstrap reading.  You can copy the template given in that reading if you want, but then add your own content.  Or start with one of the other templates at: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_grid_ex3&stacked=h">First Example Template</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_templates.asp">Other Example Templates.</a>
          </p>
          <p>But that's just the column thing.  There are other aspects to responsiveness.  Many of these can be handled with a set of media queries, that can contain any styling you want.
          </p>
          <p>Include a set of media queries with <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=tryresponsive_mediaquery_breakpoints">standard break points.</a>(600, 768, 992 and 1200px)  Include at least some styling in each one.  It can be a different font size, font family and background color or whatever.
          </p>
          <p>Images may have to be given the img-responsive class to get them to shrink when viewed on a phone (or not?)  Anyway, you can read about that <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_img_responsive&stacked=h">here</a>
          </p>

        Make sure that 
        <ul>
            <li>
                "collapsing columns" type of responsiveness works.
            </li>
            <li>
                you have a set of media queries with standard break points.  Include at least some styling in each one.
            </li>
            <li>
                images shrink to fit when viewed on a phone.
            </li>
        </ul>
