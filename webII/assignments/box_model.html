        <h4>The box model gives us a way to do layout that is more sophisticated than using a table. </h4>
        <p>The &lt;div&gt; tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The &lt;div&gt; element is often used as a container for other HTML elements. You will need to use it for this assignment. Here is a good online resource to review and
          learn about how to use div:

          <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/div-tag-html/">GeeksforGeeks on &lt;div&gt; </a></li>
          
        </ul>
        <h4>In this assignment you will learn the box model and play with it to get a solid understanding. </h4>
      
        
        <p>View the <a href="../../powerpoint/boxModel.ppt">slideshow</a>.
            After viewing the slides, <em>copy</em> the "lounge_work" folder (HS/Student/WebDesign/lounge_work) to your folder in the S: drive.  Open the lounge.html page in
          Brackets. Make doubly sure you are working with your own
          copy, not the original.
        </p>
        <p>See the boxes "Our guarantee" and "Weekly elixir specials?"
          Where are these styled? What kind of padding, borders and
          margins are used? What controls the position of the guarantee?
          Open the CSS page "lounge.css" in Brackets. Remove the
          id="guarantee" from the html of the p element containing the
          guarantee. Save and view the result. Put it back the way it
          was. Down in the place where #elixirs is styled, comment out the
          float like this: /*float: right;*/. Save and view the result.
          Put it back the way it was.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure the words of the guarantee fit within the blue-green area. If not, fix things so that they do fit.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'd rather see the rest of the text (I call it the "write-up") placed in the area between the guarantee and the "elixirs" box. It's your task to make that happen.
        </p>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block" id="first" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#oss">
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-collapse-down"></span> Hints -> Open
        </button>
        <div id="oss" class="collapse">
            <p>One way to get the three "boxes" to display side-by-side is shown in the GeeksForGeeks link, above. You put all three things in divs or other elements and then give all 3 the style to float left.</p>
            <p>You might still have to control the width of each of the three elements by styling them with width properties.</p>
            <p>Be sure to check what happens when the user opens the window wide. You don't want the text at the bottom to come up and fill in; it looks bad. To prevent this, you can put all of that bottom stuff into a single div element and then style it with clear:both.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Then get the three sections (guarantee, write-up and exilirs box) to line up at their tops.

          <p>Still confused? I find <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Box_model">Mozilla's Box Model Page</a> to be a nice, clear, explanation.</p>

          Date: Friday, 4/17/20</h4>
          <h4>The assignment: you will be making a page similar to the Head First Lounge page</h4>
          <li> Choose your own topic and content. </li>
          <li>Save the file as box_model.html</li>
          <li>Think about each html element as a box, as presented in
            the <a href="../../powerpoint/boxModel.ppt">slideshow</a></li>
          <li> Make a right-hand sidebar using a div element which contains an h2 and three sets of (h3, img, p) similar to what was done in the Head First Lounge</li>
          <li>Give the div an id and style it with width, border, padding, margin, text-align, background and anything else you want. Position it at the right.</li>
          <li>Have several paragraphs (p elements) of "write-up" text, as well as one special p element whose text begins with "our guarantee" or something like that.</li>
          <li>Give that p element an id, similar to what was done with #guarantee in Head First Lounge.</li>
          <li>Then style #guarantee with background, a fancy-looking border, padding, margins, font-family and line-height. Position it at the left.</li>
          <li>As before, make sure the "write-up" text fills in the area between the two side panels.</li>
          <li>As before, make sure the tops of the side panels and "write-up" text line up nice.</li>
          <li>Put all of the style in an external style sheet, if you haven't already.
          </li>
