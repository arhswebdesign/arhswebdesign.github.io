          these ideas into practice as a web designer.</h4>
        <h4 class="assign">Project 4: Repetition, Due date: Wednesday, 5/12/21</h4>
        <p>
            Choose a topic and some content that you want to use in making a well-designed web site. Use at least one small visual element like the triangles or the dots that were used as examples in the slides. Create 3 pages and use the element throughout all three. Use a single external style sheet for all your style rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will probably already have several other stylistic things that are consistent across all 3 pages. Just think about it. Simply by using the same style sheet for all 3 pages you are giving them consistent colors, fonts, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a code comment, write about how your use of repetition unites the user experience across the entire web site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discuss, seperately, at least three things that you repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
            When everyone has finished the assignment, each of you will tell the whole class about your three uses of repetion.
        </p>
