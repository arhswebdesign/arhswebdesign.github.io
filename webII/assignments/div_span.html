        <p>In this assignment you will begin to use the new html5
          semantic elements, as well as the div and span tags. These tags are used to group and structure a
          web document.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>Until recently, many advanced web pages were mostly made up
          of &lt;div&gt; elements, and they were distinguished using
          classes or ids.</p><br>
        <p>In html5, new elements have been introduced.&nbsp; This saves
          time when styling, but also helps search engines
          learn more about your page's content and structure.</p>
        <p>In order to see the difference, look at figures "Listing
          1" and "Listing 2" provided <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-html5/">here</a><br>

              <img src = "s1.gif" style = "float:right; padding-right: 5em;" alt = "example of page layout using semantic elements" title = "example of page layout using semantic elements">
              <li>article</li>
              <li>details</li>
              <li>figcaption</li>
              <li>footer</li>
              <li>header</li>
              <li>main</li>
              <li>mark</li>
              <li>nav</li>
              <li>section</li>
              <li>summary</li>
              <li>time</li>
              <li>aside</li>
              </li>
            </ul> 
        <p>Please examine this example of how the float tutorial part 9 could have been written using semantic elements:
        <img src= "side-by-side.png.png" width = "900px" alt = "side by side code of the float9 assignment, with divs versus semantic elements" title = "side by side code of the float9 assignment, with divs versus semantic elements">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Note how explicit id's and classes no longer have to be used to describe different elements when writing stylesheets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think of how these elements might help screen readers to present information to those who can't hear.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: You will still find many, many older web sites that use: <br/>
            &lt;div class="article"&gt;<br/>
            &lt;div class="main"&gt;<br/>
            &lt;div class="section"&gt;<br/>
            rather than the semantic elements.

        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Create an html file called "semantic.html". You may use your template to get started.</li>
          <li>
            Choose a new topic and use all new content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think about creating logical sections for the web page.
          </li> 
          <li>
            Make a site of similar complexity to the one you made for the box model assignment, again doing the layout using the box model and positioning elements with the tools you learned there (such as float:right, etc.).</li>
          <li>However, this time, use the new semantic tags available.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              ex. header, footer, navigation, wrapper/content, main text.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Use at least <strong>six</strong> different semantic
            elements in your web page.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>You can set up elements inside other elements as a
                way of categorizing information.</li>
            </ul>
                <li>
                  Use the span tag at least once in this assignment to
                  create a special, inline section
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use an external style sheet to style the semantic
                  elements and spans on the page
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remember to validate your code.
                </li>
      
              </ol>
