        <p>In this assignment you will begin to use the "semantic" elements, as well as the div and span tags. These tags are used to group and structure a web document.
        </p>
        <p>Until recently, many advanced web pages were mostly made up
          of &lt;div&gt; elements, and they were distinguished using
          classes or ids.</p>
        <p>The "semantic" elements have been introduced to save
          time when styling, but also to help search engines
          learn more about your page's content and structure.</p>
        <p>
          "Semantic" refers to the fact that the element names have more meaning (article, footer, etc.) rather than "div" which is neutral.</p>
        <p>In order to see the difference this makes, look at figures "Listing
          1" and "Listing 2" provided <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-html5/">here</a><br>

          <h3>All Semantic Tags:</h3>
          <ul>
              <img src = "s1.gif" style = "float:right; padding-right: 5em;" alt = "example of page layout using semantic elements" title = "example of page layout using semantic elements">
              <li>article</li>
              <li>details</li>
              <li>figcaption</li>
              <li>footer</li>
              <li>header</li>
              <li>main</li>
              <li>mark</li>
              <li>nav</li>
              <li>section</li>
              <li>summary</li>
              <li>time</li>
              <li>aside</li>
            </ul> 
        <p>Please examine this example of how this example code could have been written using semantic elements:
        <img src= "side-by-side.png.png" width = "900px" alt = "side by side code of the float9 assignment, with divs versus semantic elements" title = "side by side code of the float9 assignment, with divs versus semantic elements">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Note how explicit id's and classes no longer have to be used to describe different elements when writing stylesheets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think of how these elements might help screen readers to present information to those who can't hear.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: You will still find many, many older web sites that use: <br/>
            &lt;div class="article"&gt;<br/>
            &lt;div class="main"&gt;<br/>
            &lt;div class="section"&gt;<br/>
            rather than the semantic elements.
        </p>
        <h3>span</h3>
        <p>
          The span element is used whenever you want to apply style (for example, text color) to a small phrase. Please read about it <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_span.asp">here.</a>

        <h3>Newspaper assignment</h3>
        <p>
          Create an example newspaper front page that highlights some major things that have happened in your life lately (i.e. Lil Uzi Vert Finally Drops Eternal Atake). You can also make some funny headline up; this assignment is just testing your understanding of semantic elements (with creativity). Your assignment should include at least 2 articles (either using &lt;section&gt; or &lt;article&gt; but know the difference), 2 “ads” on the side of the articles (using &lt;aside&gt;), a big headline (using &lt;header&gt;), several bits of information about the paper (like dates/author/sources/etc. using &lt;nav&gt;), and some kind of information in the footer (using &lt;footer&gt;). Must use at least one image, whether it be for an “ad” or maybe the header.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            For this project, do your coding in the html and css files of the repl.it Project 6.</li>
          <li>
            Use at least 8 semantic tags properly (footer, header, nav, article, aside, section, etc).
          </li>
          <li>
            At least 2 articles/sections, with clear understanding of differences.
          </li>
          <li>
              At least one image with proper placement and proper tags (alt-text, src, and title)
          </li>
          <li>
              Header is the top element, followed by some information about the newspaper below (using &lt;nav&gt; or &lt;figcaption&gt;)          
          </li>
          <li>
              At least 2 “ads” using the &lt;aside&gt; semantic element.  
          </li> 
          <li>
              Use the span element at least once.
          </li>
          <li>
              Show creativity with newspaper-style layout.
          </li> 
          <li>
            Do the layout using the box model and position elements with the tools you learned there (such as float:right, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
              Show creativity with the articles.
          </li> 
          <li>
             Use an external style sheet to style the semantic elements and spans on the page
          </li>
