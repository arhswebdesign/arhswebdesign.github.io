        <p>In this assignment you will begin to use the "semantic" elements, as well as the div and span tags. These tags are used to group and structure a web document.
        </p>
        <p>Until recently, many advanced web pages were mostly made up
          of &lt;div&gt; elements, and they were distinguished using
          classes or ids.</p>
        <p>The "semantic" elements have been introduced to save
          time when styling, but also to help search engines
          learn more about your page's content and structure.</p>
        <p>
          "Semantic" refers to the fact that the element names have more meaning (article, footer, etc.) rather than "div" which is neutral.</p>
          <p>In order to see the difference this makes, look at the blocks of code below.</p>
          <p><br></p>

          <h3>Html 5 Semantic Tags:</h3>
          <ul>
              <img src = "s1.gif" style = "float:right; padding-right: 5em;" alt = "example of page layout using semantic elements" title = "example of page layout using semantic elements">
              <li>article</li>
              <li>details</li>
              <li>figcaption</li>
              <li>footer</li>
              <li>header</li>
              <li>main</li>
              <li>mark</li>
              <li>nav</li>
              <li>section</li>
              <li>summary</li>
              <li>time</li>
              <li>aside</li>
            </ul> 
        <p>Please examine this example of how this example code could have been written using semantic elements:
        <img src= "side-by-side.png.png" width = "900px" alt = "side by side code of the float9 assignment, with divs versus semantic elements" title = "side by side code of the float9 assignment, with divs versus semantic elements">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Note how explicit id's and classes no longer have to be used to describe different elements when writing stylesheets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think of how these elements might help screen readers to present information to those who can't see.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: You will still find many, many older web sites that use: <br/>
            &lt;div class="article"&gt;<br/>
            &lt;div class="main"&gt;<br/>
            &lt;div class="section"&gt;<br/>
            rather than the semantic elements.
        </p>
        <h3>span</h3>
        <p>
          The span element is used whenever you want to apply style (for example, text color) to a small phrase. Please read about it <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_span.asp">here.</a>

        <h3>Newspaper assignment</h3>
        <p>
          Create an example newspaper front page that highlights some major things that have happened in your life lately (for example, "Indigo De Souza drops her new album: All of This Will End"). You can also make some funny headlines up; this assignment is just testing your understanding of semantic elements (with creativity). Your assignment should include at least 2 articles (using &lt;article&gt;), 2 “ads” on the side of the articles (using &lt;aside&gt;), a big headline (using &lt;header&gt;), several bits of information about the paper (like dates/author/sources/etc. using &lt;nav&gt;). You don't need to make them links, but on a full web site, they would be. Also include some kind of information in the footer (using &lt;footer&gt;). Must use at least one image, whether it be for an “ad” or maybe the headline article.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            For this project, do your coding in the html and css files of the repl.it Project 6.</li>
          <li>
            Use at least 7 semantic tags properly (footer, header, nav, article, aside, section, etc).
          </li>
          <li>
              Show creativity with newspaper-style layout.
          </li> 
          <li>
              Show creativity with the articles.
          </li> 
          <li>
              At least 2 article elements,.
          </li>
          <li>
              At least one image with proper placement, alt and title tags)
          </li>
          <li>
              Newspaper's "masthead" is the top element, followed by some information about the newspaper below (using &lt;nav&gt;)          
          </li>
          <li>
              At least 2 “ads” using the &lt;aside&gt; semantic element.  
          </li> 
          <li>
              Use the span element at least once.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do the layout using the box model and position elements with the tools you learned there (such as float:right, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
             Use an external style sheet to style all elements on the page
          </li>
