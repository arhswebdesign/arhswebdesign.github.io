<h4>Creating your student digital portfolio</h4>

<ul>
<li>You began your portfolio when you created your web design folder for this course.</li>
<li>Think if that folder as the root folder for your portfolio</li>
<li>You will create other folders inside it for all of your school subjects: Math, Science, Social Studies, English, Electives.</li>
<li>Put your web design work in a web design folder inside the electives folder.</li>
<li>Seniors: even though you are graduating in a few short weeks, think about building this portfiolio for the future, like next year when you are in college.</li>
<li>Think, sketch, plan & think some more about the structure of the portfolio, so that you have the entire structure well thought out before beginning any coding or styling.</li>
<li>
Read the <a href="../../webI/general/plansite.html">Planning a Website</a> page and begin the planning phase. Submit plans for every website you intend to build before starting to actually build it.</li>
<li>Plan, design and build a template for each unique page in the portfolio first. Then roll out the other pages. If all pages look and feel the same, then you only need to build one template for the site.</li>
<li>Comment the code in each template file before you begin production so that you don't have to go back later and comment all of the code in each separate page.</li>
<li>No tables used for layout</li>
<li>Use div, box model concepts and floats to create the layout</li>
<li>Remember: floated items must have a width set, unless they are images, which already have a width</li>
<li>Work with internal style while building the template and then set up that style in an external style sheet when you roll out the rest of the pages.</li>
<li>Use CSS extensively to give greater control over all aspects of how the site looks.</li>
<li>Name the first page of your portfolio index.html.</li>

<li>Use your web design skills to create the home page for your portfolio. This page represents you. It provides the first impression. </li>

<li>As with all web sites, the portfolio should have an images folder.</li>
<li>Each major section of the portfolio, in this case representing a subject studied in school, should have its own home page, so the user knows where s/he is.</li>
<li> Navigation to all major areas in the site should be available on every page.</li>
<li>Test all links.</li>
<li>Create <a href= "http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp">alt text</a> for all images</li>
<li>Be sure to effectively use the keywords and description meta tags.</li>
<li>Be smart (efficient) with classes</li>
<li>Think about how inheritance can play a role</li>
<li>Validate the code</li>



</ul>
