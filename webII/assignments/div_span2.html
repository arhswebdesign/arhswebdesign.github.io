 Due Date: wednesday, 4/26/16: </h4>
 <h4>In this assignment you will begin to use the new html5 semantic elements, as well as the div and span tags to explore how they work. These tagsare used to group and structure a web document. Think about how elements on a web page can be grouped to create structure, and then the group can be styled. Rather than styling a lot of elements individually, we can now style a group of elements.Divisions and Spans</h4>
<p>Until recently, many advanced web pages were mostly made up  of &lt;div&gt; elements, and they were distinguished using classes or ids.</p>
<p>In html5, new elements have been introduced.&nbsp; This saves typing when styling, but also helps  automated search engines learn more about your page's content and structure.</p>
<p>In order to see the difference, look at the figures  &quot;Listing 1&quot; and &quot;Listing 2&quot; in this link:<br />
  <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-html5/">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-html5/</a></p>
<p>The new elements are often called the &quot;html5 semantic  elements.&quot;&nbsp; To learn why, and to  learn about their importannce, please&nbsp;  read this entire page: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp</a></p>
<p>New html dog link, this one on sectioning:<br />
  <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/sectioning/">http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/sectioning/</a></p>
<p>There's a nice flowchart here, to help you decide which of  the new semantic elements to use in any given situation.<br />
  <a href="http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/">http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/</a></p>
<p>You don't need to read the article, just maybe save or even  print out the flowchart.</p>
<p>DO ASSIGNMENT, BELOW</p>
<p>Since this is new, I'm trying to change the whole Web Design  II website to consistently stay loyal to the new html5 way of doing  things.&nbsp; please help me out by pointing  out things I can change or improve.

<ul>
<li> Create an html file with latin text </li>
<li>Save the file as semantic.html</li>
<li>Think about creating logical sections for the web page, as  presented in the <a href="../../powerpoint/Div.ppt">slideshow</a></li>
<li> header, footer, navigation, wrapper/content, main text are some typical divisions on a web page</li>
<li>Use at least <strong>eight</strong> different semantic elements in your web page.</li>
<li>One can also set up elements inside other elements as a way of categorizing information</li>
<li> Use the span tag at least once in this assignment to create a special, inline section</li>
<li>Use an external style sheet to style the semantic elements, divs and spans on the page to learn how valuable these elements are.</li>
<li>Remember to validate your code</li>
<li> Send me an email informing me that you have completed the assignment</li>
