<h4>The Good Design Archive</h4>

<p>You should already have created a folder and an index page in you portfolio for the Good Design Archive.</p>

<p> This project focuses on developing an eye for good design. Students will search the web for examples of good design and collect these sites in the archive. Each listing in the archive will be annotated. To annotate is to create notes about something. In this case students will write a few clear, detailed sentences about the qualities of good design in each site listed. We will work on this throughout the trimester.</p>

<p>Begin this assignment by finding 6 sites for the archive.#3 of these sites should be examples of good design and 3 should show poor design or design that could be improved.</p>

<h4>Tasks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Consider first impressions of websites as you browse the net.</li>
<li>How would you rate a particular site: 
<ul style= "font-weight: bold;">
<li>Wow!</li>
<li>Good</li>
<li>Ok</li>
<li>Needs Work</li>
<li>Poor Quality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now analyze what is causing the effects of the design
<ul style= "font-weight: bold;">
<li>Take notes on your thoughts about how the design was created. What elements on the page stand out? These notes will be the annotations for each site.</li>
<li>Begin a list of sites with notes on each one.</li><li>Save these notes in a text file in your design_archive folder</li>
<li>Post your design archive websites and notes on your good design archive home page. Link to each of the sites you discuss</li>
</ul>
</li>
