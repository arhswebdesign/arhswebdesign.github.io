        <h3>Bootstrap is one of the "frameworks" most used by modern web designers. <br>
        </h3>
        <p>A framework is a style sheet, prepared by someone else, which makes sure that the web pages look good on phones, tablets and desktops (called "responsive" web design).  They also generally have lots of other, nice, styling shortcuts which coders can avail themselves of. We will begin by exploring the styling shortcuts and then have a later lesson on responsive web design.</p>
        <p>The Bootstrap style sheet includes many shortcuts to good-looking styling.  The CSS is already written by the authors of Bootstrap and you can apply it to an html element by giving it the correct class.</p>
        <p>Go to W3schools and begin reading <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_typography.asp">Bootstrap Typography tutorial. </a> <br/> It shows how, just by linking to the bootstrap css, you get to use many new or re-defined elements and classes.  Be thinking of which of these you might be able to use.</p>
          
        <p>
            <strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>You need to add a link and two scripts to the head element your html file for this to work. Each of the W3Schools examples has these. Just look carefully and copy them.
          
          </p>
        <p>Also be thinking about what you could use these convenient style shortcuts for, as you read the following sections.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_images.asp">BS Images</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_tabs_pills.asp">BS Tabs/Pills</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_navbar.asp">BS Navbar</a></li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Assignment: </h3>
        <p>Create a new web page on a new topic. Include several sections of text and several images. For the layout, you can use flexbox or the box model, whichever you want. Part of this lesson involves creating a navbar with links, which are clickable. Those links can just be links out to places on the internet, if you want.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Typography</dt>
                <dd>Use 5 of the elements or classes described in the BS Typography page AND include a code comment in your html file, listing the 5 that you chose.</dd>
            <dt>Images</dt>
                <dd>Use at least one of img-rounded, img-circle or img-thumbnail to give your images a new look.</dd>
            <dt>Navbar or Pills</dt>
                <dd>Create a navbar on your page using one of the styles shown on the BS Tabs/Pills or BS Navbar pages.</dd>
