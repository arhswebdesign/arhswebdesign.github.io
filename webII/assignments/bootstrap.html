        <h3>Bootstrap is just one of the "frameworks" used by modern web designers. <br>
        </h3>
        <p>A framework is a style sheet, prepared by someone else, which makes sure that the web pages look good on phones, tablets and desktops.  They also generally have lots of other, nice, styling shortcuts which coders can avail themselves of. </p>
        <p>Go to W3schools and begin reading <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp">the Bootstrap tutorial. </a> <br/>
        Read the first two section of the tutorial.  On the sidebar at left, these are called BS HOME and BS Get Started.  These pages talk about responsive web design, which is a major reason you should learn Bootstrap.  However, for this first lesson, I want to focus on something else entirely.  The Bootstrap style sheet also includes many shortcuts to good-looking styling.  The CSS is already written by the authors of Bootstrap and you can apply it to an html element by giving it the correct class.</p>
        <p>Read BS Typography. It shows how, just by linking to the bootstrap css, you get to use many new or re-defined elements and classes.  Be thinking of which of these you might be able to use.</p>
        <p>Also be thinking about what you could use these these convenient style shortcuts for, as you read the images buttons and navbar sections.</p>
        <hr>        
        <h3>Assignment: </h3>
        <p>Create a new web page on a new topic. Include several sections of text and several images. The links in the buttons and navbar can be links out to places on the internet
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Typography</dt>
                <dd>Use 5 of the elements or classes described in the BS Typography page AND include a code comment in your html file, listing the 5 that you chose.</dd>
            <dt>Images</dt>
                <dd>Use at least one of img-rounded, img-circle or img-thumbnail to give your images a new look.</dd>
            <dt>Buttons</dt>
                <dd>After reading the BS Buttons, page, click on the link at the bottom, Complete Bootstrap Button Reference. That page will give you a fuller view of the possibilities in Bootstrap's buttons.  Include at least one of these buttons on your page. Don't use the basic or default button styles.</dd>
            <dt>Navbar</dt>
                <dd>Create a navbar on your page using one of the styles shown on the BS Navbar page.</dd>
