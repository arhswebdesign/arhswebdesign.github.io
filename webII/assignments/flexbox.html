                Flexbox is a new way of organizing a large set of elements within a container. It's awesomely convenient if you have a bunch of articles that you want to have the same importance in the eyes of the user. It handles the placement for you. It automatically adjusts to different screen sizes by changing how many things are in each row. It is favored by most web designers.

        <ul>

          <li>Open Project 6 in replit. I copied the first file you will need into index.html and style.css, so you can start with that.
          </li>
          <li>Browse to the <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">mdn Flexbox lesson</a> and read the first half, working the example as you go.  You may stop just before "Flexible sizing of flex items."</li>
          <li>When you are done, use the example as a starting point, but change the content, colors and other aspects of style to make it your own. One idea is to do a "top ten" list. You must have (at least): 
              <ol>
                <li>header, styled</li>
                <li>Make your own choices in the styling, throughout the page.</li>
                <li>section, styled</li>
                <li>10 articles inside the section</li>
                <li>Choose some interesting content to put in the articles</li>
                <li>Use display</li>
                <li>Use flex-wrap</li>
                <li>Use flex</li>
                <li>Use justify-content (if there isn't much leeway in where the articles display within each one's alloted space, then justify-content won't do much. But do it anyway.)</li>
                <li>Add other stuff if you want to.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Submit your finished work.</li>
