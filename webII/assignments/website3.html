            <h4>The goal of this project is for you to show your accumulated
                web design skills in a web site of your choice</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>This website should represent your best efforts to show your
                web design skills</p>
            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <h4>Clear design concept</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>thought given to design</li>
                <li>design creates a sense of unity in the site</li>
                <li>shows a clear look and feel</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Layout</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Now that you have learned the box model, do not go back to
                    using tables to layout a web page. Instead, use your new
                    knowledge of the box for layout. Keep building on that so
                    you continue to learn. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Styling for Responsive Web Design</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>columns collapse at smaller screen sizes. You can copy a template if you want: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_grid_ex3&stacked=h">First Template</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_templates.asp">More Templates.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Include a set of media queries with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=tryresponsive_mediaquery_breakpoints">standard break points.</a>(600, 768, 992 and 1200px)
                </li>
                <li>media queries are used to cause images to change size as screen changes size
                </li>
                <li>media queries are used to determine at least one other aspect of styling on small vs. large screens</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Other CSS Styling</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="../css/external.html">All styling through the
                        external style sheet</a>
                </li>
                <li>Don't use a table for laying out the page.
                </li>
                <li>Show an
                    understanding of the layout of webpages
                    using CSS. This includes aspects of the<a href="../../powerpoint/boxModel.ppt"> box model</a>, such as <a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/index.htm">floating</a>
                    and efficient use of <a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/index.htm">selectors</a></li>
                <li>style font</li>
                <li>style font size</li>
                <li>style background</li>
                <li>use colors well</li>
            </ul>
