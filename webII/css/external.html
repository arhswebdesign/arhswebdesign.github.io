          <h4>Explore the "cascade"</h4>
          <p>Read at this link to review the meaning of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp">external, internal and inline</a> style.</p>
          <p>The way in which the different sections of style code all affect the final web page is like a waterfall (a cascade).</p>
          <img src="cascade.png" width = 500px>
          <p>How do all the style rules come together to style a page? What happens when there are conflicting instructions?</p>
        <h4 class="assign"> Assignment Due Date: Monday, 4/10/23</h4>
        <p><strong>First page (just external style):</strong></p>
        <p>Choose a topic and some text and images for a quick little web page.</p>
        <p>Use the existing "index.html" file in the repl.it project.</p>
        <p>Make a nice-looking page that includes, among other things, text-containing elements (p, h2, h3, etc.). </p>
        <p>Before linking to an image, you need to bring the image into the repl.it project. In repl.it, to the right of the word "Files," is an icon that looks like 3 dots. Use it to upload a file. Or you can "drag-and-drop" into the "Files" section.</p>
        <p>Please use new code for this assignment.  </p>
        <p>Put all of your style rules into the external style sheet (style.css).</p>
        <p>Include all of the following (at least):</p>
         
        <ul>
          <li>Background: image or color</li>
          <li>Text  color</li>
          <li>Use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_google_fonts.asp"><strong>Google fonts)</strong></a></li>
          <li>Font size</li>
          <li>Border</li>
          <li>Margin</li>
          <li>Padding</li>
          <li>Lists: use at least one ordered and one unordered list </li>
          <li>Pseudo-classes: set the color for these states of
            hyperlinks: link, visited, hover</li>
          <li>Give at least one html element a class and style that class in the style sheet.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Second page (external_internal.html):</strong></p>
        <p>I have created a second html file for you in the repl.it project ("external_internal.html").</p>
        <p>Repl.it's "Run" button always runs the file named "index.html."</p>
        <p>So for you to view the second page the way a user would, you have to use a link from the "index.html" page to get there.</p>
        <p>I already created a link from the first file to the second and back again, to show/remind you how that works. </p>
        <p>The contents of the "external_internal.html" file should initially be a copy of the first page. So, just copy-paste it. Don't forget to change the title. It should continue linking to the same external style sheet.</p>
        <p>Don't change the external SS.</p>
        <p>Using internal style, intentionally set up <strong>at least three conflicts</strong>. For example, you could style the background color DodgerBlue, even though it might already have been styled aqua in the external style sheet. This is so you can see for yourself how the style rules &quot;cascade&quot;. In other words, which style is applied when 2 or
          more rules are giving different style directions?</p>

        <p><strong>Third page (all_three.html):</strong></p>
        <p>Create a third html file in the repl.it project (Use the "Add files" button to the right of the word "Files."). Name the new file "all_three.html". It should initially be a copy of the second page. Don't forget to change the title. It should continue linking to the same external style sheet.</p>
        <p>Don't change the external SS.</p>
        <p>The third sheet will start off identical to the second. Then add inline style to change two the same three style rules, yet again. So, for example, instead of DodgerBlue or aqua, you could make the background plum. See how the page looks.</p>
        <p>When finished you should have 3 html pages all linked to one single css file.</p>
        <p><strong>Add additional links so each page links to the other two.</strong></p>
