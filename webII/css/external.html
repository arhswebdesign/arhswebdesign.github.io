          <p>Read at this link to review the meaning of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp">external, internal and inline</a> style.</p>
          <p>How do all the style rules come together to style a page? What happens when there are conflicting instructions?</p>
        <h4 class="assign"> Assignment Due Date: Wednesday, 2/5/20</h4>
       <p><strong>First page (just_external.html):</strong></p>
        <p>Make a nice-looking web page that includes, among other things, text-containing elements (p, h2, h3, etc.) to which you have applied a background color or image that is different from that of the body. This should be all new code.  Put all of the style  rules into an external
          style sheet.</p>
          <p>Include all of the following (at least):</p>
         
        <ul>
          <li>Background: image or color</li>
          <li>Text-containing elements: color, alignment, and background-color (or background-image)</li>
            <li>Font: family <a href="http://www.awayback.com/index.php/2010/02/03/revised-font-stack/"><strong>(stack</strong></a> or use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_google_fonts.asp"><strong>Google fonts)</strong></a>, size,  and boldness (font-weight)</li>
          <li>Border
            border</li>
          <li>Margin</li>
          <li>Padding</li>
          <li>Lists: use at least two different lists: one ordered and one unordered list </li>
          <li>Pseudo-classes: set the color for these states of
            hyperlinks: link, visited, hover</li>
          <li>Give at least one html element a class and style that class in the style sheet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Second page (external_internal.html):</strong></p>
        <p>Create a second page. It can initially be a copy of the first page. Don't forget to change the title. It should continue link to the same external style sheet.</p>
        <p>Don't change the external SS.</p>
        <p>Using internal style, intentionally set up <strong>at least three conflicts</strong>. For example, you could style the background color DodgerBlue, even though it might already have been styled aqua in the external style sheet. This is so you can see for yourself how the style rules &quot;cascade&quot;. In other words, which style is applied when 2 or
          more are giving different style directions?</p>
        <p><strong>Third page (all_three.html):</strong></p>
        <p>The third sheet should start off identical to the second. Then add inline style to change the same two style rules, yet again. So, for example, instead of DodgerBlue or aqua, you could make the background plum. See how the page looks.</p>
        <p>When finished you should have 3 html pages all linked to one single css file.</p>
        <p><strong>Add links so each page links to the other two.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Put all the files for this assignment, including images, if any, in a separate folder.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
