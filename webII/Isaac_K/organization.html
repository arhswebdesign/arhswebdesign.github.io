<h3>Making a template</h3>
<p>To start the actual coding, make a template page that you can save multiple times as different pages and then add content to after. Play around with alignment of text as well as margins and padding now, so it looks exactly how you want, but without content and in black and white. 
<a href="planning/templatealt.html">Here is the page that was the template for this site.</a> 
It has color as well, but you can see what I mean about a template page. I used a style sheet and made the page, assigned classes to elements, and then styled it. The page I made as an unstyled template looked like 
<a href="planning/templateus.html">this,</a>
 but I set up classes or id's to all the elements I wanted to style so I was ready to jump right into styling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Links</h3>
<p>Decide on what pages you want the site to have now, when you're on the template, and what the name of each page will be. In the section of your page that is the navbar, make an unordered list of links to these pages, even though you haven't made them yet. This way they are in the template and you don't have to copy paste the list of links to each page you make. If you want to have the list horizontal instead of vertical, use the code 'display: inline;' in the style section of the page relating to unordered lists (the styling of the page is on the next page of this site, you haven't missed anything).</p>
