<h3>Brainstorming ideas</h3>
<p>If you already have an idea you want to go with, skip this section and go down on the page.</p>
<p>To start off your site from nothing, make a brainstorm of ideas you could go with. Write the ideas down  on paper or a word processor. Once you have ideas, choose one you could see being the basis for a website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Detailing the site</h3>
<p>Do roughly a one page write up on your ideas for the site. The site is meant for the audience, so use these questions, with the audience in mind, to plan out your site:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason the website exists</li>
<li>Who are they?</li>
<li>What is their age group?</li>
<li>What are their special interests?</li>
<li>What is their assumed prior knowledge?</li>
<li>What does the audience need to know that the website will provide?</li>
<li>How can the site design fit the audience?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering those questions develops your website further before you even get started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>On a sheet of paper, make a sketch of what you want a page to look like, with boxes of text and other elements. Label them. Make it logical and simple. This can also be done on Powerpoint, which is what I did for this site, which looks <a href="Planning/Pagesketch.pptx">like this.</a></p>
