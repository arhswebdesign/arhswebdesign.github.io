<h4>Welcome to Web Design I. </h4>
<p> This one-trimester course is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of Web site design and creation. Organization and navigational design, visual layout, and selection of material will be covered.</p>
<p>Students will learn the Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML), and also work with FrontPage and Dreamweaver MX, web authoring software applications. Students will design and create websites from a variety of perspectives including the personal, business and educational. </p>

<p>This is a hands-on course that requires time at a computer workstation to fulfill all class project objectives. In order to succeed, students may have to spend time after school in a computer lab. A community service project involving the design and creation of a Web site is required.</p>

<h4>
Topics covered in the course include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The World Wide Web</li>
<li>Designing for the web</li>
<li>XHTML</li>
<li>WYSIWYG Web Design Software</li>
</ul>
<p>
In this course, we will discuss aspects of web design and you will work with a computer to put these ideas into practice. This practical work will open the door for you to experiment with xhtml and the web authoring programs with the idea that through exploration you will learn the fundamentals of web design and site creation. The material is cumulative in many ways. In other words, much of the material you will learn builds on what you have already learned in the class. So, you have to be ready to learn from the beginning to build a solid foundation.

<h4>
Troubleshooting:
</h4>
<p>This is a skill that cannot be overemphasized when it comes to working with computers in general. Troubleshooting is the process through which one attempts to solve problems. In this class you will be solving web design problems. You may want to take notes on the troubleshooting you succeed with so that the next time your can quickly recall what you did.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in pursuing computers as a career, keeping notes on troubleshooting will develop the habit of documenting your work, an important skill when working with a team whether in a web design environment, a software writing environment or in a computer network analysis environment.
</p>

<p>You are expected to use Groupwise to send assignments and receive information. You should set up your Groupwise account to use the web based mail feature so that you can access your school email account from outside of school.
