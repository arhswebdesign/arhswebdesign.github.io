<h4>Welcome to Web Design II. </h4>
<p>This course is designed to review the beginning steps of Web site design and creation, and progress deeper into layout and styling with cascading style sheets. The planning and design processes are emphasized. Organization and navigational design, visual layout, and selection of material will be covered. Particular emphasis is placed on creating the Home page and navigation. </p>

<p>Students will review the  HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and develop strong working knowledge of CSS. Students will design and create web sites and digital portfolios. 
</p>
<p>
This is a hands-on course that requires time at a computer workstation to fulfill all class project objectives. In order to succeed, students may have to spend time after school in a computer lab. </p>
<h4>
Topics covered in the course include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li> Cascading Style Sheets </li>
<li>Brackets Web Design Software</li>
<li>Design Principles</li>
<li>The importance of the audience</li>
<li>The World Wide Web</li>
</ul>
<p>
In this course, we will discuss aspects of web design and you will work with a computer to put these ideas into practice. This practical work will open the door for you to experiment with html and CSS with the idea that through exploration you will progress in your understanding of web design and site creation. The material is cumulative in many ways. In other words, much of the material you will learn builds on what you have already learned in the class and in Web Design 1. So, you have to be ready to learn from the beginning to build a solid foundation.

Troubleshooting:

<p>This is a very important life skill. Troubleshooting is the process through which one attempts to solve problems. In this class you will be solving web design problems.
