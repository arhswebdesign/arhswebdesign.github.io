<h4>Welcome to Web Design II. </h4>
<p>This course is designed to review the beginning steps of Web site design and creation, and progress deeper into layout and styling with cascading style sheets. </p>

<p>Students will review the  HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and develop strong working knowledge of CSS. There will also be a chance to learn some basic JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
This is a hands-on course that requires time to fulfill all class project objectives. In order to succeed, students may have to spend time outside of class. </p>
