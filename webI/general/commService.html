<h4 class="assign"> 
This project requires that you create a website for someone or some organization affiliated with the high school and /or the community. </h4>
<h4 class="assign">This Project is due at the end of the term, during the week of 6/23/14, but you may turn it in earlier if you complete it before the end of the term.</h4>
<p>Think about:
<ul>
<li> school clubs</li>  
<li> school teams</li>
<li> teachers</li>
</ul> </p>

<p>This project extends our goodwill out into the community as we offer our web design skills to those who may need them. Inform the people you talk with in your search for a client that this is a community service assignment for a class, and that they will benefit by receiving a fully functional website.</p>

<p>You are responsible for completing the site and giving a copy of it to the community member. You are not responsible for the ongoing maintenance of the site.</p> 

<p>Your assignment early in the term is to start looking for someone to work with. Then interview him/her, create the site and teach them how to use it. You are required to find a teacher, school team or club, community service or business for whom to create a website. This will require some initiative on your part. You will need to talk to a variety people to find someone to work with. </p>          
<hr />

<p>Once you have found someone needing a website, set a time to meet with him/her to have a conversation about what his/her needs are for a website. Find out if they have some design ideas they would like to see used. Prepare some questions ahead of time to have ready to ask the client as you learn about their needs and ideas for the website. What kind of site will it be? Take notes on this conversation so that you can use them in the design and building process. </p>

<p>For example, what kinds of information will be important on a teacher&#39;s website? After the meeting to learn what the client&#39; s needs are, make some preliminary sketches of the home page and one or two other pages to show the client. Get their ok on the sketches, and then submit them to me. Once the sketches are submitted to me, you may take the next steps in building the site. </p>

<p> This project is due by the end of the trimester. It is not the only projectthat will be due at that time, so do not procrastinate on getting started with it.</p>
<hr />

<h4>General requirements for the site:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Brainstorm a list of ideas  that explores the audience: who are they? what do they need from the website? </li>
    <li>Submit a brief written explanation of the client and the organization's needs for a web site. Explain who the audience is for this site and what they need to know that the web site can provide? Be specific and clear in your writing. Submit that before proceeding with the next steps.</li>

  <li>Use powerpoint to create a storyboard of the web site to show the client. This is a series of sketches that show your ideas for the web site. Submit the sketches to me for feedback.</li>
  <li> Once I give you the ok on the sketches, begin creating the web site.</li>
    <li>The more planning you can do ahead of time, the more smoothly and efficiently the site building will go.</li>
    <li>Name the first page index.html. This page must be saved in the main website folder, the root folder, no deeper than that.</li>
    <li> Organize all files for this site into folders that make sense. Think about that. What makes sense organizationally?</li>
    <li>Create an images folder in the website folder and put <em>all</em> images in it.</li>
    <li>Use tables to create the layout</li>
    <li>Use external style sheets to style all pages in the site</li>
    <li> Be sure all links work</li>
    <li> Include alternate text for all images</li>
    <li> Include an email link</li>
    <li> Navigation should be easily accessible and simple to manage</li>
    <li> Organize your html code so that it is easy to read</li>
    <li> Include comments in your code to explain what each section is about</li>
