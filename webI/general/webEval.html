<h4 class="assign">Evaluating Web Site Design Assignment

Due Date: Wednesday, 12/8/10:</h4> 

<h4><a href="../classNotes/classNOtes.html">Powerpoint Slideshow Assignment Explanation</a></h4>
<p>
This assignment supports our investigation of good and bad design of web sites. Your task will be to evaluate at least two sites using <a href="../../general/webeval.doc">the handout on web design criteria</a>. One of the sites that you will evaluate will be an example of good design and the other an example of bad design. You may evaluate more than two sites if you like.
</p>
<p>
To evaluate something is to analyze it closely and carefully. This is not necessarily a negative analysis. There may be some positive and some negative qualities a site has, but you do need to eventually take a stand and state that the web site works well or does not, based on the overall assessment of it. </p>

<p> Using the <a href="../../general/webeval.doc">Web Design Criteria handout</a>, look at the web sites in terms of the three major areas of <span style ="font-weight: bold">Content, Organization and Appearance, </span>and more specifically in terms of the categories within each major area. Use the Web Design Evaluation Checklist to keep a record of your evaluation. Use this as your notes when preparing your presentation and the written evaluation.
</p>
<p>
You will present your findings to in a small group. Guide the group through your evaluation and point out the parts of the web site that make it a good or bad design.
</p>
<h4>Tasks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create 3 powerpoint slides to organize your ideas. Use the slides in your presentation.
</li>
<li>
Write a 1 page critique of web design using the two sites you studied as the focus of your analysis.
</li>
<li>
Submit the powerpoint slides and the written critique to me as attachments via email. Writing standards for any academic writing will be used to evaluate the writing.
</li>
<li>
The sites are open to your choice. However, as with everything else in the class, they must be school appropriate.
</li>
