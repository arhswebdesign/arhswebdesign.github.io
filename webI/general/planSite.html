        <h4> Think, Brainstorm, Plan, Build</h4>
        <p>

        Imagine that you work for a small web design company, and that you have been put in charge of planning and creating a new web site for a new client. In this assignment, you will be creating a fictitious client who wants this web site built, and then following the steps in the process of planning and creating the web site.
        </p>
        <h4> The Client:</h4>
        <p>
        Create a fictitious client who works for a company or organization that needs a web site. Spend some time thinking about who the client is and what his/her needs are for the web site based on his/her organization's needs. Create a brief written explanation of the client and the organization's web needs. 
        </p>
        <p>Example: check out this website, <a href = "http://www.readertoreader.org"> readertoreader.</a>
        Who is the client running the organization? What needs did he have for his web site? What kind of web site is this?  
        </p>
         <h4> The Audience:</h4>
        <p>
        Who is the audience for this site and what do they need to know that the web site can provide? Be specific and clear in your writing. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Here are some points to address:
        </p>
  
        <h5> Communicate to the Audience: the main purpose of the site</h5>
       
        <ul>
          <li>The reason the website exists</li>
          <li>Who are they?</li>
          <li> What is their age group?</li>
          <li>What are their special interests?</li>
          <li>What is their assumed prior knowledge?</li>
          <li>What does the audience need to know that the website will
            provide?</li>
          <li>How can the site design fit the audience?</li>
        </ul>

          writing any code</span>)</li>
          <li>Think, brainstorm.</li>
          <li> Submit a 1 page (300 word minimum)
            explanation/description of the <strong><em>client</em></strong>, the <a
href="https://purplebox.digital/matching-web-design-to-target-audiences/"><strong><em>audience</em></strong></a>
            (see 7 points, above), the <strong><em>website</em></strong>, and details of <em><strong>how the website is appropriate</strong></em> for the audience. Include a discussion of <em><strong>style choices</strong></em> and how they will work well for your audience.</li>
          <li>Submit <em><strong>sketches</strong></em> for the site, one sketch for every unique
            page layout design.  Use powerpoint or Google Slides to make the sketches of the page layout
            designs. If you use Slides, save as .pptx (File-&gt;Download as-&gt;Microsoft Powerpoint) and put file in the normal place. Do not &quot;share&quot; it with me.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you start coding before the planning is over, you will
          lose 10% of the project's points.</p>
