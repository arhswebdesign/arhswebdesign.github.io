        <h4>To begin</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Press Windows-E, open ThisPC and then open
            S:\HS\Student\WebDesign</li>
          <li> Pause to study the path to that folder. Each name,
            separated by a slash, is a folder. It's a series of folders
            within folders. We will be using and thinking about
            pathnames frequently in this class. </li>
          <li> Look for a folder inside S:\HS\Student\WebDesign with your last name.</li>
          <li> You will save all of your web design work in this
            portfolio/folder.</li>
          <li>Create other folders inside your web design portfolio.
            Name these as follows: early_work, middle_work, later_work, first_site, final_site, other.</li>
            <li>early_work can hold the files from the first assignments up to intro. styling</li><li>middle_work can contain the next few assignments up to layout table.</li><li>later_work can contain the next assignments up to the "cascading style sheets" assignment.</li>
       
          <li>Any assignment where you have more than one file, make a separate folder for the assignment.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>The shared drive honor system, S:\</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Work in your folder only</li>
          <li> Good idea to back up your work to your H:\ once a week.
            Simply copy your folder from the shared drive and paste it
            into your H:\.</li>
          <li> Report any problems with S:\, asap.</li>
          <li>The computer network is monitored all day, every day. When
            there is a problem with files deleted from a shared drive,
            we can find out who deleted the files within minutes. </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          Daily routines</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Log into your computer as bell rings</li>
          <li> Open Brackets, the class
            web site, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">the
              W3Schools web site</a>, and your folder on
            S:\HS\Student\webDesign. </li>
          <li>Keep these open throughout the class. Add <a
              href="http://www.w3schools.com/">the W3Schools web site</a>
            to your favorites so that it is easily accessible.</li>
          <li> Turn off monitors during teacher talk.</li>
          <li>As the trimester progresses, there is less and less
            teacher talk and more hands on work.</li>
          <li> Working rhythm: write html code in a Brackets file, save
            it as .html file, and use the lightning bolt to open and view that page in a web browser. Write code, view. Write code, view. </li>
          <li>This allows you to see changes to
            the web page you are building.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          Naming your files:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>When you save a web document, whether it is a page, an
            image, or an object, give it a name related to the
            assignment, a name that makes sense, in the correct format.
          </li>
          <li>Name your assignments with short, descriptive file names.
          </li>
          <li> For example, the second file created in assignment 1 should be named something like
            basic_tags.html</li>
          <li>Use the underscore character instead of spaces between
            words in a file name.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          Using <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">W3
            Schools online tutorials</a> for learning and practicing
          html and css</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Study the examples that site shows us and then practice
            writing the code. </li>
          <li>Do not simply copy and paste information from W3Schools
            into your .html files. You won't learn anything by doing
            this and it is very obvious when someone has copy/pasted.</li>
          <li>Since copy/pasted work is not yours, it is plagiarized,
            and will result in a 0 for that assignment. All school rules
            regarding plagiarism will be followed in all cases of
            plagiarism.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          Using the class web site effectively
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Browse around the site to learn where things are stored.</li>
          <li> Read each assignment completely and pay close attention
            to the details.</li>
          <li>Make sure each assignment is completed before moving on to
            the next assignment. Use the assigned tasks as a checklist
            to keep track of your work.</li>
          <li>Add the site to your favorites.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>use the help list on the white board </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Asking for help when you need it, after you have thought
            about and tried to solve the problem, is a sign of
            intelligence.</li>
          <li>Asking for help <em><strong>instead of</strong></em>
            thinking for yourself and <em><strong>before </strong></em>trying
            to solve problems is a sign of laziness</li>
          <li>Use the help board when you need help but do work on your
            troubleshooting skills by trying to solve the problem
            yourself. </li>
        </ul>

        </h4>

          <li>Look at school e-mail for my comments on each assignment.<br>
