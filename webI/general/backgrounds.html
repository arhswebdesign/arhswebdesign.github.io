<h4>
1. What is a good Background?</h4> 

<ul>
  <li> Like a good referee in a sporting event, a good background should go unnoticed.</li>
  <li>If we want the audience to notice the background, make it the foreground.</li>
  <li>If the audience is noticing the BG, too much, then they are not really seeing the content of the page.</li>
  <li>By default, a BG image repeats, tiles, so think about how that will effect the image you want to use for the BG.</li>
  <li>Texture images and colors tend to work well as BG when they tile, repeat, over the page.</li>
  <li>Representational images are things that people recognize. They represent something we know: a person, a mountain, a cloud, a bicycle, things like that.</li>
  <li>Representational images do not work very well as BG images because the audience gets drawn into thinking about and looking at the image they recognize and don't really see what in the foreground.</li>
  <li><a href="../examples/Bad_tiling_example.html">Check out this BG.</a> What do you think?</li>
  <li>What is the point of having a website if the audience is too busy looking at the BG? </li>
  <li><a href="../examples/texture_background_example.html">How about this one? </a> Is it improved? </li>
</ul>
<h4>
2. good background resource:</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.grsites.com/archive/textures/">Grsites.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>
3. Avoid this common background mistake </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Rather than write the path to the background image online, download the image into your images folder.</li>
  <li>To download an image, right click on it as select &quot;Save Picture As.&quot;</li>
  <li>Then browse to your images folder on the shared drive and save it there.</li>
  <li>If you simply write the image path to the image online, you are dependent on that website to keep the image appearing on your site. </li>
  <li>That's not a chance you want to take.</li>
  </ul>
<h4>4. Body Background-image Property</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp">Study this W3Schools site</a></li>

</ul>
<h4>Background
        Tips</h4>
        <p>
          Set a background image using CSS. If the image is smaller than
          the browser window, the image will repeat itself until it
          fills the entire browser window. Study the W3SChools
          information on styling backgrounds to learn how to better
          control the image.
