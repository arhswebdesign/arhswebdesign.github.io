<h4>Welcome to Web Design I. </h4>
<p> This course is designed to introduce you to the beginning steps of Web site design and creation. Styling of text, colors, visual layout, organization and design of navigation will be covered. </p>
<p>You will learn the  HyperText Markup Language (HTML), beginning cascading style sheets (CSS) and will also work with the repl.it online coding environment. </p>

<p>This is a hands-on course that requires time spent coding, in order to succeed. To finish all of the projects, you may have to spend time outside of class. </p>
<hr />

<p>The material is cumulative in many ways. In other words, much of the material you will learn later in the course builds on what you learn in the beginning of the course. So, you should learn each lesson thoroughly and try to remember it. Otherwise you will have to re-learn it to use it later.
</p>
