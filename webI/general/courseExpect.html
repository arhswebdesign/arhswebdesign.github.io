<h4>Welcome to Web Design I. </h4>
<p> This course is designed to introduce students to the beginning steps of Web site design and creation. Organization and navigation design, visual layout, and selection of material will be covered. </p>
<p>Students will learn the  HyperText Markup Language (HTML), beginning cascading style sheets (CSS) and will also work with  the web design editor Brackets. </p>

<p>This is a hands-on course that requires time at a computer workstation to fulfill all class project objectives. In order to succeed, students may have to spend time after school in a computer lab. </p>
<!--<p>A community service project involving the design and creation of a Web site is required.</p>-->
<hr />
<h4>
Topics covered in the course include:</h4>


<ul>
  <li>HTML, a computer-based web       language</li>
  <li>Beginning CSS, another computer-based       web language</li>
  <li>Brackets Web Programming Editor. </li>
  <li>Design Principles</li>
  <li>The importance of the audience</li>
  <li>The Internet</li>
  </ul>

<p>
In this course, we will discuss aspects of web design and you will work with a computer to put these ideas into practice. This practical work will open the door for you to learn html and CSS. This setting of daily mini lessons on many aspects of web site design and lots of hands on work creates a productive class for you to learn the beginning steps of web design. </p>

<p>The material is cumulative in many ways. In other words, much of the material you will learn later in the course builds on what you have to  learn in the beginning of the course. So, you have to be ready to learn from the beginning to build a solid foundation.

Troubleshooting:
</h4>
<p>This is a very important life skill. Troubleshooting is the process through which one attempts to solve problems. In this class you will be solving web design problems. You may want to take notes on the troubleshooting you succeed with so that the next time you may quickly recall how the problem was solved.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in pursuing computers as a career, keeping notes on troubleshooting will develop the habit of documenting your work, an important skill when working with a team whether in a web design environment, a software writing environment or in a computer network analysis environment.
