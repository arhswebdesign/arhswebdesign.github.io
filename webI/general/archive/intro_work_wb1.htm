    <td rowspan="2" valign="top"  class="content"><h4>To begin </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Open My Computer on the computer desktop and then open G:\HS\Student\webDesign\moriarty\spring_06. 
        </li>
        <li> Create a folder inside G:\HS\Student\webDesign\moriarty\spring_06 
          and name it with your last name and first initial, example: moriartym 
          <br>
          You will save all of your web design work in this folder. </li>
        <li> Create six other folders inside your web design folder. Name these 
          as follows: design_ideas, xhtml , dreamweaver, frontpage, misc and images. 
          <br>
          Use these folders to help you manage all of your web design files. </li>
        <li>Create other folders as necessary.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The shared drive honor system, G:\ </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>work in your folder only </li>
        <li>good idea to back up your work to your h:\ once a week. </li>
        <li>report any problems with G:\, asap. </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Daily routines</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Log in to your computer as bell rings </li>
        <li>Open Notepad, my website: http://www.arps.org/users/hs/moriartm/, 
          the W3Schools website, and your folder on G:\HS\Student\webDesign\moriarty\spring_06. 
          Keep these open throughout the class. Add these two websites to your 
          favorites so that they are easily accessible. </li>
        <li>Turn off monitors during teacher talk (15-25 minutes) </li>
        <li>Students hands on study of xhtml and wysiwyg (35-45 minutes)</li>
        <li> Working rhythm: write xhtml code, save it as .html file, refresh 
          browser page. Save, refresh, save, refresh, save refresh. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Naming your files:</p>
      <p>When you save a web document, whether it is a page, an image, or an object, 
        give it a meaningful name in the correct format. Name your assignments 
        with short, descriptive file names. For example, assignment 1 should be 
        named something like basic_tags.html . Use the underscore character instead 
        of spaces between words in a file name. <br>
        All first pages of a web site are named index. This is a general rule 
        which is true for most web hosts. </p>
      <p>Using W3 Schools online Tutorials for learning and practicing xhtml and 
        css</p>
      <p>http://www.w3schools.com/default.asp <br>
        Using my website effectively</p>
      <p>browse around the site to learn where things are stored. <br>
        pay close attention to the details of each assignment. <br>
        add the site to your favorites. <br>
        Using groupwise to send work and all communications</p>
      <p>Groupwise = school email. Find it in the Novell delivered application 
        window. <br>
        Set up groupwise for remote access. <br>
