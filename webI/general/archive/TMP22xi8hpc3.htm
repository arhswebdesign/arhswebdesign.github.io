        130D Library, 362-1755, x1755<br>
        moriartm@arps.org </h4>
      <p>Welcome to Web Design I. This one-trimester course is designed to introduce 
        students to the fundamentals of Web site design and creation. Organization 
        and navigational design, visual layout, and selection of material will 
        be covered. Students will learn the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). 
        Students will also work with FrontPage and Dreamweaver MX, web authoring 
        software applications. Students will design and create Websites from a 
        variety of perspectives including the personal, business and educational. 
        This is a hands-on course that requires time at a computer workstation 
        to fulfill all class project objectives. In order to succeed, students 
        may have to spend time after school in a computer lab. A community service 
        project involving the design and creation of a Web site is required.</p>
      <h4>Topics covered in the course include:</h4>
      &#8226; The World Wide Web<br> &#8226; Website Design<br> &#8226; HTML<br> 
      &#8226; WYSIWYG web design software 
      <p>This is a hands on course in which we will discuss aspects of web design 
        and you will work with a computer to put these ideas into practice. This 
        practical work will open the door for you to experiment with html and 
        the web authoring programs with the idea that through exploration you 
        will learn the fundamentals of web design and site creation. The material 
        is cumulative in many ways. In other words, much of the material you will 
        learn builds on what you have already learned in the class. So, you have 
        to be ready to learn from the beginning to build a solid foundation. </p>

      <h4> Troubleshooting:</h4>
      <p>This is a skill that cannot be overemphasized when it comes to working 
        with computers in general. Troubleshooting is the process through which 
        one attempts to solve problems. In this class you will be solving web 
        design problems. You may want to take notes on the troubleshooting you 
        succeed with so that the next time your can quickly recall what you did. 
        For those who are interested in pursuing computers as a career, keeping 
        notes on troubleshooting will develop the habit of documenting your work, 
        an important skill when working with a team whether in a web design environment, 
        software writing environment or in computer network analysis environment. 
      </p>
      <h4>Communication and submitting work:</h4>
      <p>You are expected to use Groupwise to send assignments and receive information. 
        You should set up your Groupwise account to use the web based mail feature 
        so that you can access your school email account from outside of school. 
        Here are the directions for setting up remote access.</p>
      <h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
      <p>&#8220;A&#8221; work is extraordinary. It exceeds most criteria and requirements 
        for all assignments, projects, and quizzes. The &#8220;A&#8221; project 
        goes well beyond the minimum. Attention to detail is excellent in &#8220;A&#8221; 
        work. The person who earns an &#8220;A&#8221; is always on task and focused 
        in class and does not need to be reminded to get to work.</p>
      <p>&#8220;B&#8221; work is very good. It exceeds some and meets some of 
        the criteria and requirements for all assignments, projects, and quizzes. 
        The person who earns a &#8220;B&#8221; is on task and focused in class. 
        Attention to detail in general is good.</p>
      <p>&#8220;C&#8221; work is average. It meets the general requirements for 
        all assignments, projects, tests and quizzes. &#8220;C&#8221; work shows 
        that someone completed the minimum requirements on all assignments, projects, 
        and quizzes. Attention to detail is adequate but not complete in &#8220;C&#8221; 
        work. The person who earns a &#8220;C&#8221; is occasionally off task 
        and needs to be reminded to get to work.</p>
      <h4>Submitting Assignments:</h4>
      <p>Submit assignments as attachments in an email. Put the assignment name 
        in the subject line of the email.</p>
      <p>Use the following file naming format when you submit assignments:<br>
        &#8226; username_assignment name, <br>
        &#8226; Example: moriartm_website evaluation</p>
      <p>You may find that you have to spend time after school working on your 
        web design labs and projects so that you can stay on pace to complete 
        all of the required work. I will be available upon request to meet in
