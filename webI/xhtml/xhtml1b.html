        <p> </p>
             <h4> 1. Preparing to work:</h4>
        <p> Open Brackets, this
          web site, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/default.asp"
            target="_blank">the w3schools web site</a> and your web
          design folder, and keep these all open throughout each class
          while you are learning html. You will be writing the html code
          in Brackets.</p>
        <h4> 2. Saving your work:</h4>
        <p> In order to see the html code as a web page, you must save
          all html work with a .html file extension. For example, you
          could save a file as basic_tags.html .</p>
        <p> Save all of your work to: </p>
        <p>S:/HS/Student/Web Design/student_folders/yourName/
            folder. The early assignments
          should all go in the "early_work" subfolder. </p>
        <h4> 3. Viewing your work:</h4>
          <p> There are two ways to view your html work as a web page,</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Use the lightening bolt in Brackets</li>
          <li>Type Windows-E and browse to your folder. Double click your page's file, which should appear with the web
          browser icon. If you are not seeing the web browser icon, then you must not
          have saved the file with a .html file extension. Try again.</li></ol>

        <h4> 4. View your web page often: </h4>
        <p>Your working
          rhythm should be to write some html code, then check out the web
          page to see the new changes. Change and view. Change and view.</p><h4 class="assign">Intro. to Styling ASSIGNMENT- Due

        <h4> Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
        <p> Q: After I have edited an html file, I cannot view the
          result in my browser, why?</p>
        <p><br>
          A: Make sure that you have saved the file with a proper name
          and extension like "mypage.html". Also make sure that you use
          the same name when you open the file in your browser</p>
        <p> Q: I have tried to edit an html file but the changes don't
          show in the browser. Why?</p>
        <p><br>
          A: The browser caches your pages so it doesn't have to read
          the same page twice. When you have changed a page, the browser
          doesn't know that. Use the browsers refresh/reload button to
          force the browser to read the edited page.</p>
