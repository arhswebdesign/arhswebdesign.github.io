        <h4> 1. The Image Tag and the Src Attribute </h4>
        <p>In HTML, images are defined with the &lt;img&gt; tag. </p>
        <p>
          To display an image on a page, you need to use the src
          attribute. Src stands for "source".
          The value of the src attribute is the URL of the image you
          want to display on your page.</p>
        <h4>
          The syntax for defining an image:
        </h4>
        <p>
          &lt;img src="url"&gt;</p>
        <h4>
          The URL points to the location where the image is stored.</h4>
        <p> SAVE LOCAL COPIES OF EVERY IMAGE YOU CAN.</p>
        <p>An image named "boat.gif" located in the directory "images"
          (that is in the same folder as your html page) has the URL:
          "images/boat.gif"</p>
        <p>(if you can't save the image for some reason) An image named
          "boat.gif" on "www.w3schools.com" has the URL:
          http://www.w3schools.com/images/boat.gif. </p>
        <p>
          The browser puts the image where the image tag occurs in the
          document. If you put an image tag between two paragraphs, the
          browser shows the first paragraph, then the image, and then
          the second paragraph.
        </p>
        <h4>The ALT Attribute </h4>
        <p> The alt attribute is used to define an "alternate text" for
          an image. The value of the alt attribute is an author-defined
          text:</p>
        <p> &lt;img src="boat.gif" alt="sailboat"&gt;</p>
        <p> The "alt" attribute tells the reader what he or she is
          missing on a page if the browser can't load images. The
          browser will then display the alternate text instead of the
          image. </p>
        <p>Screen readers will read this alternate text aloud, so it
          conveys information to non-readers, blind users, or people
          that have text-only browsers.</p>
        <p>Include the "alt" attribute for each image on a page. </p>
        <p>If you don't, it's not considered valid html.</p>
        <h4>The title Attribute </h4>
        <p> The title attribute is used to provide a tooltip for an
          image. Tooltips are the words that pop-up on screen if you
          position the cursor over the image and wait for a quarter
          second. The title attribute is also author-defined:</p>
        <p> &lt;img src=&quot;boat.gif&quot; title=&quot;Big Boat&quot;&gt;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4> The Width (or Height) Attribute </h4>
        <p> The width attribute is used to make the image smaller:</p>
        <p> &lt;img src=&quot;boat.gif&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;&gt;</p>
     
        <p>You can give both a width and a height, but if you do both, be careful! You risk stretching or scrunching the image.</p>
        <h4>Center an Image </h4>
        <p> Here's <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp">a link</a> if you need to center an image. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
        <h4>Align an Image Relative to a Line of Text</h4>
        <p>  Float:left and float:right are very effective at positioning, together with moving the &lt;img&gt; element up or down within the &lt;p&gt; element. You will probably want to adjust the margins of the img and perhaps the padding of the td.</p>

          2. ASSIGNMENT 7 Due Date: Monday, 4/2/18:</h4>
        <p>Decide on a topic; collect some images, write some text.</p>
        <p>Begin with a copy of a previous template with a full page layout table.  Make it completely new with new styling.  Perhaps put some
          headings on the page.</p>
        <p> Display different images in the following ways. You may need
          to create more than one page to complete this:</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp">Study
            this section of W3Schools to learn about the image tag.</a></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Background image: set an image as the background for a
            page. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp">Find
              information on this here in W3Schools.</a>
            
          </li>
          <li>
            Let an image float. (This controls it's position in the left-right direction): show an image float to the left or
            right of a paragraph. Use float:right or float:left.</li>
          <li>
            Align images (at least two) within
            a mass  of text, using float, margin and padding</li>
          <li>
            Adjust images to different sizes </li>
          <li>
            Display alternate text for all &lt;img&gt; elements in this assignment.            </li>
          <li>Use the title attribute for all &lt;img&gt; elements in this assignment. </li>
          <li>
            Make at least one image a clickable link to somewhere else.</li>
