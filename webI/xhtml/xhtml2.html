        <h4> New vocabulary: <em>Nesting</em> html tags:</h4>
        <p>This means to place one set of tags inside another. When
          nesting tags, the inside tags open and close before the
          outside tags close. For example,</p>
        <pre><code> 
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt; element is nested within the p element.&lt;/p&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <h4> Spacing: </h4>
        <p>Spacing is tricky when writing html because the browser strips out all spaces, tabs and returns and just puts in one space between words. </p>
        <p>It will, however respond to special tags that create space such as &lt;br&gt;.</p>
        <p>
            If you want to add spaces, one at a time, you can use the non-breaking space: "&amp;nbsp;". &amp;nbsp; is also known as an “entity” in html. We’ll learn more about entities in the next section.
          </p>

        <h4 class="assign"> Project 4 Due Date: Thursday, 9/14/23</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
              In order to have two pages linked together, you must first have another html file in the repl.it project. I have created a second html file for you in the repl.it project ("page_two.html"). Repl.it's "Run" button always runs the file named "index.html." So you always have to start there. But you can click on a link and it will display the linked page. Try it. Now click the new link to get back. Examine the two files until you are confident that you understand how the links work.
          </li>
          <li>
              Open your html_template.html from Project 1 and examine it. If there's a lot in there you want to have in this new    assignment, you can copy the whole thing and paste it into the new project's index.html. You will then have to re-create links. Or you can keep the new project's index.html and just add pieces of code.
          </li>
          <li>
              Create a nice, good-looking page, using things you know how to do, like different headings and paragraphs. 
          </li>
          <li>
              You can choose your own topic if you want. If you want a suggestion, try this:  do a little page about a place, somewhere in the world, that you would like to visit someday. Link out to flights to the nearest city and a hotel in the city. Then explain how to say basic sentences in the language of that country so that your users will be able to talk to the residents. This may require you to use some special characters, which you can do with html entities.        
          </li>
          <li>
              This creative addition of content will help you to get full points, but don't forget to do some styling, like you learned in the last assignment.&nbsp; 
          </li>

          <li>DO NOT USE ANY CONTENT FROM project 1 OR project 3.</li>
          <li>Remember to change the title of the page in the
            &lt;title&gt; tags, so that it is more appropriate to your content. 
          </li>
          <li>
              Add some small amount of content to "page_two.html." You may copy the style element from index.html.
          </li>            
          <li>
              <strong>Use at least one entity somewhere on the page.</strong>
          </li>

          <li>Link index.html to a third html page that you create in the repl.it project (Use the "Add files" button to the right of the word "Files."). Name the new file "page_three.html" or something that ends in .html.  It doesn't have to be fancy, but please use new content, not old material. Again, you may copy the style rules from index.html. </li>
          <li>Link to a site out on the internet, somewhere. Note: If the link appears not to work when you click on it, it may be a repl.it issue. If you use the "Open in a new tab" feature, then the link will work. But otherwise, it might not.</li>
          <li>Link <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links_bookmarks.asp">to a place within the same html document (Link to an
          element with a specified id; aka &quot;link to a bookmark&quot;)</a> </li>
          <li>Use a background image. This is sort-of like a link, but different. <a href="../general/backgrounds.html">Instructions.</a>
          </li>
              
          <li>Submit the project. </li>
