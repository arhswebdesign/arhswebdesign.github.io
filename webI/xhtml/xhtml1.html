        <h4> 1. Preparing to work:</h4>
        <p> Open Brackets, this
          web site, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/default.asp"
            target="_blank">the w3schools web site</a> and your web
          design folder, and keep these all open throughout each class
          while you are learning html. You will be writing the html code
          in Brackets.</p>
        <h4> 2. Saving your work:</h4>
        <p> In order to see the html code as a web page, you must save
          all html work with a .html file extension. For example, you
          could save a file as basic_tags.html .</p>
        <p> Save all of your work to: </p>
        <p>S:\HS\Student\webDesign\your folder. The early assignments
          should all go in the "early_work" subfolder. </p>
        <h4> 3. Viewing your work:</h4>
        <p> To view your html work as a web page, open My Computer and
          browse to your folder. </p>
        <p> Double click your page, which should appear with the web
          browser icon.</p>
        <p>If you are not seeing the web browser icon, then you must not
          have saved the file with a .html file extension. Try again.</p>
        <h4> 4. Refresh the web page: </h4>
        <p>Remember to save any changes you make to the file before
          trying to view them. Refresh the web page in the browser
          before viewing any new changes. The web designer's working
          rhythm is to write some html code, save it and refresh the web
          page to see the new changes. Save and refresh. Save and
          refresh. Save and refresh.</p>
        <h4>5. Now we will create a page template with all of the
          necessary html tags so you can begin each assignment with the
          correct foundation code.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Open Brackets and do File->Open Folder, navigate to where your folder is highlighted and click the "Select Folder" button at the bottom.  This sets your "project" folder in Brackets.</li>
          <li>Then save the file as html_template.html in
            your early_work web folder.</li>
          <li> Type the tags into your template file that you see in the
            <a href="basicStructure.html">basic structure of every html
              web page file</a> here. Follow the html standards when
            writing html code </li>
          <li>To save the file, click File =&gt; Save As =&gt;, then
            change the "Save as type" box to "All files". Give the file
            a name, add .html at the end, then save.</li>
          <li>If you have saved correctly the file should appear with a
            web browser icon next to it in the folder.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> 6. How to use the online tutorial web site, <a
            href="http://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">W3Schools</a>:</h4>
        <p> Read the content of the assigned sections of the HTML
          tutorial, study the examples and practice using the tags. Then
          write your code in your Brackets file. </p>
        <p>DO NOT COPY THE CODE FROM W3SCHOOLS. THAT IS PLAGIARISM AND
          WILL RESULT IN A 0 FOR THAT ASSIGNMENT. ALL CONSEQUENSES FOR
          COMMITTING PLAGIARISM, OUTLINED IN THE STUDENT HANDBOOK, WILL
          BE APPLIED WHEN SOMEONE IS CAUGHT COPYING CODE.</p>
          <h4> 7. Read the sections called <a href= https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp> html introduction</a> 
              &amp; <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp>elements</a>:</h4>
        <p> Learn and understand the following terms and how they apply
          to html: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Elements: What are they?</li>
          <li>Tags: What are tags and how does one work with them in
            html?</li>

        </ul>
        <h4><br>
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4> 8. Study the <a
            href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp">Headings</a>
          &amp; <a
            href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp">Paragraphs</a>
          pages on w3schools </h4>
        <p>Practice using all of the tags there to learn them. Be sure
          to look at all of the information in the center column of the
          page. This is the content section on w3schools. Also study the
          examples for each page, at the end of the content section.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4> <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp">Headings





            page on w3schools </a></h4>
        <p> Here you will learn the 6 headings tags, the tags for making
          horizontal lines on the page and the tags for including hidden
          comments in the code.</p>
        <h4> <a
            href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp">Paragraphs





            page on w3schools</a></h4>
        <p> Here you will learn the paragraph tag as well as tags for
          creating line breaks.</p>
        <p>You will also learn how html code presents text on the page,
          by default. </p>
        <h4><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp">Hidden





            Comments</a></h4>
        <p> Here you will learn how to create hidden comments. This tag
          is also used to turn code off on a page without deleting the
          code.</p>
        <h4>Questions to consider</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>What is the default color for text?</li>
          <li>How are headings different from paragraphs in appearance?</li>
          <li>Where is text aligned on the page by default? What does
            "aligned" mean?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="assign"> 9. ASSIGNMENT 1, Basic Tags- Due Date:
          Monday, 1/29/18</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>In Brackets, open the file you just created, called html_template.html.</li>
          <li><strong>Save that file as</strong> basic_tags.html</li>
          <li>Every time you create a new .html file, open the
            html_template.html file and save it as the name of the new
            file. Be sure to always add the .html file extension.
            Otherwise you will not have a web type file.</li>
          <li>Remember to change the title of the page in the
            &lt;title&gt; tags. This is the title that appears on the
            tab in the browser, and it's part of what search engines are
            looking at when you search for something on the web. </li>
          <li>Learn the basic html tags and attributes listed below and
            submit an html document that uses them. </li>
          <li>Create some organizational/layout structure using
            different headings on the page.Each heading element must
            contain some text.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Think about how web sites, magazines and newspapers are
            organized and try to create some order in your page.&nbsp;
            Don't just have an h1, then an h2, then an h3, etc.<br>
          </li>
          <li>REMEMBER: Most html tags travel in pairs, an opening tag
            and a closing tag.</li>
          <li>Write your code so that it is easy for you and me to read.
            I usually create space in the code between every set of
            tags.</li>
        </ol>
