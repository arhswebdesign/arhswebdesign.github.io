<h4>
1. Preparing to work:</h4> 

<p> Open <a href="../general/useNotepad.html">Notepad</a>, <a href="http://www.arps.org/users/hs/moriartm/">my website</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/default.asp" target="_blank">the w3schools website</a> and your web design folder, and keep these all open for the duration of each class while you are learning xhtml. You will be writing the xhtml code in Notepad.</p>

<h4>
2. Saving your work:</h4>

<p> In order to see the xhtml code as a web page, you must save all xhtml work with a .html file extension. For example, you could save  a file as early days.html .</p>
<p> Save all of your work to S:\HS\Student\webDesign\Winter1011\your folder.</p>
<h4>
3. Viewing your work:</h4><p> To view your html work as a web page, open My Computer and browse to your folder in S:\HS\Student\webDesign\Winter1011\your folder. Double click your page, which should have the blue internet explorer E as its icon.
</p>

<p>If you are not seeing the blue internet explorer E, then you must not have saved the file with a .html file extension.</p>
<h4>
4. Refresh the web page: </h4><p>Remember to save any changes you make to the file before trying to view them. Refresh the web page before viewing any new changes. The web designer's working rhythm is to write some xhtml code, save it and refresh the web page to see the new changes. Save and refresh. Save and refresh. Save and refresh.
</p>
<h4>
5. How to use the online tutorial website, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">W3Schools</a>:</h4><p> Read the content of the assigned sections of the HTML tutorial, study the examples and practice using the tags.
</p>
<h4>
6. Read the sections called html introduction, attributes &amp; html elements:</h4>
<p> Learn and understand the following terms and how they apply to html:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Elements: What are they?</li>
	<li>Tags: What are tags and how does one work with them in html?</li>
	<li>Attributes: How are attributes written? Where are they written?</li>
	<li>Values: What are they, what do they do in html and how are they written?</li>
</ul>
<h4>
7. Creating a basic xhtml web page:</h4>
<p> Every web page needs a similar foundation structure. They all have a DOCTYPE declaration to open it. This is followed by the opening &lt;html&gt; tag, the opening and closing  &lt;head&gt; tags, the opening and closing &lt;body&gt; tags and the closing &lt;/html &gt; tag. As you learned in the online tutorial, you will be writing your xhtml code in the program called Notepad.</p>
<br />
<hr />
<h4>Now we will create a page template with all of the necessary xhtml tags so you can begin each assignment with the correct foundation code.</h4>
<h4>Open Notepad and save the file as xhtml_Template.html in your S:\ xhtml web folder</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Begin each web page with a DOCTYPE declaration to declare what type of xhtml you are using.</li>
	<li>Type this code and always make sure the doctype declaration is the first piece of information in the xhtml code: 

&lt;DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"/&gt;</li>
	<li>Type the tags into your template file that you see in the <a href="basicStructure.html">basic structure of every xhtml web page file here</a>. 
	<li>Follow the <a href="xhtmlStandard.html">xhtml standards</a> when writing xhtml code</li>
</ul>

<h4>
8. Study the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp">Headings</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp">Paragraphs</a> pages on w3schools </h4>
<p>Practice using all of the tags there to learn them. Be sure to look at all of the information in the center column of the page. This is the content section on w3schools. Also study the examples for each page, at the end of the content section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4> Headings page on w3schools
</h4>
<p> Here you will learn the 6 headings tags, the tags for making horizontal lines on the page and the tags for including hidden comments in the code.</p>
<h4> Paragraphs page
on w3schools</h4>
<p> Here you will learn the paragraph tag as well as tags for creating line breaks.</p>
<p>You will also learn how html code presents text on the page, by default. </p>
<h4>Questions to consider</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What is the default color for text?</li>
  <li>How are headings different from paragrapghs in appearance?</li>
  <li>Where is text aligned on the page by default?</li>
  </ul>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

9. ASSIGNMENT 1 Due Date: Friday, 12/10/10</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Open the file you just created, called xhtml_template.html.</li>
  <li>Save that file as basic_tags.html</li>
  <li>Every time you create a new .html file, open the xhtml_template.html file and save it as the name of the new file. Be sure to always add the .html file extension. Otherwise you will not have a web type file.</li>
  <li>Remember to change the title of the page in the &lt;title&gt; tags. This is the title that appears on the tab in the browser, and it's part of what search engines are looking at when you search for something on the web. </li>
  <li>Learn these basic xhtml tags and attributes and submit an xhtml document that uses them. </li>
  <li>Create some organizational/layout structure using different headings on the page. </li>
  <li>Think about how websites, magazines and newspapers are laid out.</li>
  <li>REMEMBER: Most xhtml tags travel in pairs, an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
  <li>Write you code so that it is easy for you and me to read. I usually create space in the code between every set of tags.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tags to learn and use in the basic_tags assignment:</p>
<p>&lt;DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" &gt;<br />
  &lt;html&gt;<br />
  &lt;head&gt; <br />
  &lt;title &gt;<br />

12. Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<p>

Q: After I have edited an XHTML file, I cannot view the result in my browser, why?<br />
A: Make sure that you have saved the file with a proper name and extension like "mypage.html". Also make sure that you use the same name when you open the file in your browser</p>
<p>

Q: I have tried to edit an XHTML file but the changes don't show in the browser. Why?<br />
A: The browser caches your pages so it doesn't have to read the same page twice. When you have changed a page, the browser doesn't know that. Use the browsers refresh/reload button to force the browser to read the edited page.</p> 
<h4>
13. Basic Notes - Useful Tips</h4>
<p>
When you write XHTML text, you can never be sure how the text is displayed in another browser. Some people have large computer displays, some have small. The text will be reformatted every time the user resizes his window. Never try to format the text in your editor by adding empty lines and spaces to the text.</p>
<p>
XHTML will truncate the spaces in your text. Any number of spaces count as one. Some extra information: In XHTML a new line counts as one space.</p>
<p>
Using empty paragraphs to insert blank lines is a bad habit. Use the &lt;br /&gt; tag instead. (But don't use the br tag to create lists. Wait until you have learned about XHTML lists.)</p>

<p>
XHTML automatically adds an extra blank line before and after some elements, like before and after a paragraph, and before and after a heading. We use a horizontal rule (the &lt;hr /&gt; tag), to separate the sections in our tutorials.
