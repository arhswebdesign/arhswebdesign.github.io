        <h5>As you develop your skill with tables, your skill to lay out well-designed web pages will also
          grow.

        <h4> 1. Tables are defined with the &lt;table&gt; tag. A table
          is divided into rows (with the &lt;tr&gt; tag), and each row
          is divided into data cells (with the &lt;td&gt; tag).
        </h4>
        <p> The letters td stands for "table data," which is the content
          of a data cell. A data cell can contain text, images, lists,
          paragraphs, forms, horizontal rules, tables, etc.‚Äù<br>
          - www.w3schools.com </p>
        <p>Notice that the tags are nested. The &lt;table&gt; tags
          enclose both other sets of tags:</p>

        <p> &lt;table&gt;</p>
        <blockquote>

          <p> &lt;tr&gt;</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> &lt;td&gt;row 1, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;<br>
              &lt;td&gt;row 1, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
          <p> &lt;tr&gt;</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> &lt;td&gt;row 2, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;<br>
              &lt;td&gt;row 2, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> &lt;/table&gt;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
		<p>You would need to style it like this:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<pre>
		&lt;style&gt;
		table, td { border-style: solid;
			    border-width: thin;
		}
		&lt;/style&gt;
		</pre>
		 <p>&nbsp;</p>

            section</a> of the w3schools tutorials.</h4>
        <h4>
          4.To align text within cells, you can style td (or td, th) with text-align:center or text-align:left.  You can also center it in an up-down direction with vertical-align:top (or middle or bottom).

        <h4 class="assign"> Project 5: Due Date: Thursday, 3/4/21: Create two tables, using the above-listed skills:</h4>
        <p>
            Use two different html files for the two tables in the assignment.
        </p>
        <p>It will actually be easier to work that way, because you can use different style rules in each file. <br>
        </p>
        <p>Please link them. For example, assume you have tested your first file and then moved the contents from index.html to a new file named table_one.html. The you create your second file, test it and leave it in index.html. The place a link in the index.html file that goes to "table_one.html" or whatever you named it.</p>
        
       <h4>Style the tables, using internal style.&nbsp;</h4>
          
      
    
        <h4>Your task is to exactly recreate each of the below tables on your own.</h4>

          <figcaption>Table 1</figcaption>
          <img src="dogs.png" alt="table about dogs">

        <p>Hint: for the small lists of Tinker Bell, etc, you can put them in a p element with some &lt;br&gt; at the ends of lines and some &amp;nbsp; at the start of lines.</p>
