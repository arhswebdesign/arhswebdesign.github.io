        <h4> Creating the web site:
        </h4>
        <h4>Remember our discussions of good design.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the <a href="../../general/webeval.doc">Web Design
              Criteria Handout</a> handout as a guide for building the
            site.</li>
          <li><a
              href="../../powerpoint/don%27t%20make%20me%20think1.ppt">Site
              should demonstrate "don't make me think" qualities</a></li>
          <li>The content, language and images, must be school
            appropriate.</li>
          <li> Create a simple, but effective file naming structure for
            the pages and images used.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Choose a structure for the site:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>How many pages will you need?</li>
          <li>What kind of structure will work best for this site?</li>
          <li>Do you want your visitors to go through the site in a
            particular direction, or do you want to make it easy for
            them to explore in any direction?</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4> General requirements for the site:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do Not Build</strong> any part of the site before
            complete plans are submitted. Doing so will cost the final
            grade of the project 10% right off the top.</li>
          <li>Make a fully styled &amp; designed <strong>template</strong>
            with external style sheet before building your first page.            This saves typing, because you can start with a copy of this template for each of the pages in the site</li>
          <li>Organize all files for this site into its own folder. In
            other words, create a folder for the website and organize
            all files for the site in that folder.</li>
          <li>The site should be completely portable. In other words, we
            should be able to copy the folder, upload onto a computer
            not on the school network and everything in the site still
            functions.</li>
          <li>Create an images folder in the website folder and put all
            images in it.</li>
          <li>The file name of the first page of a web site should be
            named index.html. This is a general rule which is true for
            most web hosts.This file must be in the "root" folder, the
            main folder that holds the web site Do not put it in deeper
            in a folder within the root folder.</li>
          <li>Use tables to create the layout.</li>
          <li>Give each page a unique title, in the &lt;title&gt; tag.</li>
          <li>Use external style sheets to style all pages in the site.</li>
          <li> Be sure all links work.</li>
          <li>Include alternate text for all images.</li>
          <li>Include an email link.</li>
          <li>Navigation should be easily accessible and simple to
            manage.</li>
          <li>Organize your html code so that it is easy to read.</li>
          <li>Include <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_comment">html code comments</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_syntax2">CSS code comments</a> to explain what each section
            is about.</li>
