        <h3> Creating the web site:
        </h3>

        <h4> General requirements for the site:
        </h4>
        <p>It is wise to have all pages in your site share a consistent style.</p>
        <p>This means that you will save typing if you make one of the pages nearly complete before starting on the others. Do as much styling as you can, and put the style rules into an external style sheet.</p>
        <p>Then you can copy that first page, and use it as a starting point for each of the other pages in the site.</p>
        <p>Just change the content.</p>
        <p>Since it has a link to the external style sheet, you will continue to get the same style on all the pages.</p>
        <p>The starting place for your users is the file named index.html. The others can have any name you choose, although it must end in ".html" and it is best to use underscore rather than spaces, so "page_two.html" is better than "page two.html".</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use tables to create the layout.</li>
          <li>Create multiple pages.</li>
          <li>Give each page a unique title, in the &lt;title&gt; tag.</li>
          <li>Use an external style sheet to style all pages in the site.</li>
          <li>Be sure all links work.</li>
          <li>Include alternate text for all images.</li>
          <li>Each of the pages must have a link to all of the others. Navigation should be easily accessible and simple to
            manage. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp">One example</a> and <a href="active_class_clearest.html">my own, even simpler version</a>.</li>

            <li>Organize your <a href="https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/html-css-style-guide-students#general-formatting-rules">html</a> and <a href="https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/html-css-style-guide-students#block-content-indentation">CSS</a> code so that it is easy to read.</li>
          <li>Include <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_comment">html code comments</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_syntax2">CSS code comments</a> to explain what each section
            is about.</li>
