        <p>
          With CSS, your HTML documents can be displayed using different
          output styles:</p>

        <h4>Some History</h4>
        <p>
           In the beginning, there was only HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML tags were originally designed to define the content of a
          document. They were supposed to say "This is a header", "This
          is a paragraph", "This is a table", by using tags like
          &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tags could be styled with attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
          As more attributes (like the
         font-size, margin, color, width and background-color attributes) were added, it became more and more unwieldy to style the elements. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And it was hard to make a consistent style change across a whole website.
        </p>
        <p>
            To change the color of the h3 headings when you have 50 of them would be a lot of work.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, the CSS language was designed to solve this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
           It is now possible
            to create Websites where the content of HTML documents was clearly
          separated from the document's presentation layout.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Style Sheets Can Save a Lot of Work
        </h4>
        <p>
          Styles sheets define HOW HTML elements are to be displayed.
          Styles are normally saved in external .css files. </p>
        <p>
          External style sheets enable you to change the appearance and
          layout of all the pages in your web site, just by editing one
          single CSS document!</p>
        <p>
          CSS is a breakthrough in web design because it allows
          developers to control the style and layout of multiple web
          pages all at once.</p>
        <p>
          As a web developer you can define a style for each HTML
          element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want. To make
          a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in
          the website are updated automatically. </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h4> Syntax
        </h4>
        <p>
          The CSS syntax is made up of three parts: a selector, a
          property and a value:
        </p>
        <p>
          selector {property: value}
        </p>
        <p>
          The selector is normally the HTML element/tag you wish to
          define, the property is the attribute you wish to change, and
          each property can take a value. The property and value are
          separated by a colon, and surrounded by curly braces:
        </p>
        <p>
          body {color: black}
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: If the value is multiple words, put quotes around the
          value:
          p {font-family: "sans serif"}
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: If you wish to specify more than one property, you must
          separate each property with a semicolon. The example below
          shows how to define a center aligned paragraph, with a red
          text color:
        </p>
        <p>
          p {text-align:center;color:red}
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the style definitions more readable, you can describe
          one property on each line, like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          p { <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-align: center;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: black;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: arial<br>
          }
        </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          Grouping
        </h4>
        <p>
          You can group selectors. Separate each selector with a comma.
          In the example below we have grouped all the header elements.
          All header elements will be displayed in green text color:</p>
        <p>
          h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 <br>
          { <br>
          color: green <br>
          }</p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          A space matters
        </h4>
        <p>
          Do NOT leave spaces between the property value and the units!
          If you use "margin-left: 20 px" instead of "margin-left: 20px"
          it will not work properly.
        </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h4>
          The class Selector
        </h4>
        <p>
          With the class selector you can define different styles for
          the same type of HTML element.
          Say that you would like to have two types of paragraphs in
          your document: one right-aligned paragraph, and one
          center-aligned paragraph. Here is how you can do it with
          styles: </p>
        <p>
          p.right {text-align: right}
        </p>
        <p>
          p.center {text-align: center}
        </p>
        <p>
          You have to use the class attribute in your HTML document:
        </p>
        <p>
          &lt;p class="right"&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          This paragraph will be right-aligned.
        </p>
        <p>
          &lt;p class="center"&gt;:
        </p>
        <p>
          This paragraph will be center-aligned.
        </p>
        <p>
          To apply more than one class per given element, the syntax is:
        </p>
        <p>
          &lt;p class="center bold"&gt;
        </p>
        <p>This will apply the classes "center" and "bold" to this
          paragraph.
        </p>
        <p> You can also omit the tag name in the selector to define a
          style that will be used by all HTML elements that have a
          certain class. In the example below, all HTML elements with
          class="center" will be center-aligned:
        </p>
        <p>
          .center {text-align: center}
        </p>
        <p>
          In the code below both the h1 element and the p element have
          class="center". This means that both elements will follow the
          rules in the ".center" selector: </p>
        <p>
          &lt;h1 class="center"&gt; <br>
          This heading will be center-aligned<br>
          &lt;/h1&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          &lt;p class="center"&gt;<br>
          This paragraph will also be center-aligned.<br>
          &lt;/p&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          Do NOT start a class name with a number! It will not work in
          Mozilla/Firefox.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>
          The id Selector
        </h4>
        <p>
          You can also define styles for HTML elements with the id
          selector. The id selector is defined as a #.
          The style rule below will match the element that has an id
          attribute with a value of "green":
        </p>
        <p>
          #green {color: green}
        </p>
        <p>
          So if there is a &lt;p id="green" &gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            it will take on the style and its text will be green.
        </p>
          <p>
          The style rule below will match the p element that has an id
          with a value of "para1":
        </p>
        <p>
          p#para1<br>
          {<br>
          text-align: center;<br>
          color: red<br>
          }<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          A specific id can be used once and only once in a given html
          document. </p>
        <p>
          Do NOT start an ID name with a number! It will not work in
          Mozilla/Firefox.

        <h4>
          CSS Comments
        </h4>
        <p>
          Comments are used to explain your code, and may help you when
          you edit the source code at a later date. A comment will be
          ignored by browsers. A CSS comment begins with "/*", and ends
          with "*/", like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          /* This is a comment */ <br>
          p<br>
          {<br>
          text-align: center;<br>
          /* This is another comment */<br>
          color: black;<br>
          font-family: arial<br>
          }<br>
        </p>

        <h4>
          How to Insert an External Style Sheet
        </h4>
        <p> An external style sheet is ideal when the style is applied to
          many pages. With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an
          entire Web site by changing one file. Each page must link to
          the style sheet using the &lt;link&gt; tag. The &lt;link&gt;
          tag goes inside the head section: </p>
        <p>
          &lt;head&gt;<br>
          &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
          href="style.css" /&gt;<br>
          &lt;/head&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          The browser will read the style definitions from the file
          style.css, and format the document according to it. Repl.it already has a style.css file, so you just have to link to it, by adding the link element in the head.</p>
        <h4>
          CSS is a different language
        </h4>
        <p>Inside the style sheet, the language is CSS. So, the
          file should not contain any html tags. Your style sheet's name should
          have a .css extension.
        </p>
        <p> An example of a style sheet file is shown below: </p>
        <p>
          hr {color: sienna}<br>
          p {margin-left: 20px}<br>
          body {background-image: url("images/back40.gif")}<br>

              Multiple Styles Will Cascade Into One
            </h4>
            <p>
              CSS allows style information to be specified in many
              places. Styles can be specified inside a single HTML element,
              inside the style element of an HTML page, or in an external CSS
              file. </p>
            <h4>
              Order of Priority
            </h4>
            <p>
              What style will be used when there is more than one style
              specified for a given property of an HTML element? </p>
            <p>
                Conflicts will be resolved by the following priorities,
              with the highest priority style winning: </p>
            <ol>
              <li> External style sheet</li>
              <li> Internal style sheet (inside the &lt;head&gt; tag) </li>
              <li> Inline style (inside an HTML element) </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              So, an inline style (inside an HTML element) has the highest
              priority, which means that it will override a style declared
              in the head, or in an external style sheet).

          Internal Style Sheet: An internal style sheet should be used
          when a single document has a unique style. </h4>
            <p>You define internal styles in the head section by using the
              &lt;style&gt; tag, like this: </p>
            <p>
              &lt;head&gt;<br>

              &lt;/style&gt;<br>
              &lt;/head&gt;<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              The browser will now read the style definitions, and format
              the document according to it.

              Inline Styles: An inline style loses many of the advantages of
              style sheets by mixing content with presentation.</h4>
            <p style="color: sienna; margin-left: 20px"> Use this method
              sparingly, such as when a style is to be applied to a single
              occurrence of an element. To use inline styles you use the
              style attribute in the relevant tag. The style attribute can
              contain any CSS property. The example shows how to change the
              color and the left margin of a paragraph: </p>
            <p>
              &lt;p style="color: sienna; margin-left: 20px"&gt;
              This is a paragraph

            different style sheets, the values will be inherited from the
            more specific style sheet.
            <p></p>
            <p>
              For example, an external style sheet has these properties for
              the h3 selector:
            </p>
            <p>
              h3 <br>
              {<br>

            </p>
            <p>
              And an internal style sheet has these properties for the h3
              selector:
            </p>
            <p>
              h3 <br>

              }<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              If the page with the internal style sheet also links to the
              external style sheet the properties for h3 will be:
