    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>A first-time sighting of the bog-candle in full flower leaves the
      beholder impressed by its beauty and size. Decorating a three to
      four foot high, leafy spike are dozens of snow white flowers.
      Their outstretched lateral sepals give the flowers a curious look
      resembling little Caspar the Friendly Ghosts or flying nuns. These
      odd blossoms are a delight from an olfactory aspect as well,
      exuding the spicy fragrance of cloves. This feature gives it the
      name "scent bottle' in the northern Maritimes.<br>
      <br>
      There is but one colony of bog candles on Cape Cod, an historic
      site in East Sandwich which has been watched closely by botanists
      for many years. The habitat is thick muck formed by spring seeps
      from a clay bank. There may be a buffering agent or calcium
      depost, (perhaps from shells in an ancient Indian midden) to
      explain how this plant became established in so acidic and
      otherwise hostile an environment as Cape Cod.<br>
      <br>
      This species is rare throughout the state, with only four recorded
      sites presently known in Massachusetts*.<br>
