        <h4 class="assign">Evaluating Web Site Design Due: Monday, 9/16/19. Be prepared to present at the beginning of the period.</h4>
        <h4><a href="../../powerpoint/Web Site evaluation.pptx"> Powerpoint of the Slideshow
            Assignment Explanation</a></h4>
        <p> This assignment supports our investigation of good and bad
          design of web sites. Your task will be to evaluate at least
          two sites using <a href="../../general/webeval.doc">the
            handout on web design criteria</a>. One of the sites that
          you will evaluate will be an example of good design and the
          other an example of bad design. You may evaluate more than two
          sites if you like. </p>
        <p> To evaluate something is to analyze it closely and
          carefully. This is not necessarily a negative analysis. There
          may be some positive and some negative qualities a site has,
          but you do need to eventually take a stand and state that the
          web site works well or does not, based on your overall
          assessment of it. </p>
        <p> Using the <a href="../../general/webeval.doc">Web Design
            Criteria handout</a>, look at the web sites in terms of the
          three major areas of <span style="font-weight: bold">Content,
            Organization and Appearance, </span>and more specifically
          in terms of the categories within each major area. Use the Web
          Design Evaluation Checklist to keep a record of your
          evaluation. Use this as your notes when preparing your
          presentation and the written evaluation. </p>
        <p> You will present your findings in a small group. Guide the
          group through your evaluation and point out the parts of the
          web site that make it a good or bad design. </p>
        <h4>Tasks</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Create 3  slides to organize your ideas (<a href="../../powerpoint/Web Site evaluation.pptx">see ppt</a>). Use the
            slides in your presentation. Create links in the slides to
            each site analyzed.</li>
          <li> Write a 1 page critique of web design using the two sites
            you studied as the focus of your analysis (<a href="../../powerpoint/Web Site evaluation.pptx">see ppt</a>). Be sure to talk about as many of the line items
            from the <a
href="file:///Users/nedyoung/Teaching/ARHS/Web_design_I_course/Web_design_html/webDesign062416/general/webeval.doc">handout</a>
            as possible. Also, include some conclusions about what makes for good web design. Your writing will be evaluated for quality, so use your best writing. <br>
          </li>
          <li> Submit the  slides and the written critique to
            me in the usual way. (Make a new folder called "other" in your S: drive folder.) If you are using Google Slides and/or Google Docs, use the "File->Download as" menu item to save as a .pptx or .docx file. Save to your "other" folder on the S:
            drive. Then send me an e-mail with the filenames in the
            header of the e-mail. </li>
          <li> Your choice of sites is up to you. However, as with
            everything else in the class, they must be school
            appropriate.</li>
