        <p> If you use the internet, you already have some idea of which web sites are well-designed and which are not. Your task will be to evaluate at least
          two sites. One of the sites that
          you will evaluate will be an example of good design and the
          other an example of bad design. You may evaluate more than two
          sites if you like. </p>
        <p> To evaluate something is to analyze it closely and
          carefully. This is not necessarily a negative analysis. There
          may be some positive and some negative qualities a site has,
          but you do need to eventually take a stand and state that the
          web site works well or does not, based on your overall
          assessment of it. </p>
        <p>Look at the web sites in terms of the
          three major areas of <span style="font-weight: bold">Content,
            Organization and Appearance, </span>and more specifically
          in terms of the categories within each major area. Here are some ideas of what to look for when preparing your
          presentation and the written evaluation. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Content
            <ul>
              <li>Useful Information</li>
              <li>Purpose</li>
              <li>Identity & Audience</li>
              <li>Useful Links</li>
              <li>Spelling & Grammar</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Organization
            <ul>
              <li>Simplicity</li>
              <li>Navigation</li>
              <li>Active Links</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Appearance
            <ul>
              <li>Layout</li>
              <li>Unified and consistent look achieved through repetition of color, motif, etc.</li>
              <li>Font Use</li>
              <li>Color</li>
              <li>Graphics</li>
              <li>Text</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p> You will present your findings in a small group. Guide the
          group through your evaluation and point out the parts of the
          web site that make it a good or bad design. </p>
        <h4>Tasks</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Create 3 slides to organize your ideas (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U-fPYchx0k8oXaDi3Wnskc4dgQeznjgZupAQsMFjERI">see explanation</a>). Use the
            slides in your presentation. Create links in the slides to
            each site analyzed.</li>
          <li> Write a 1 page critique of web design using the two sites
            you studied as the focus of your analysis (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U-fPYchx0k8oXaDi3Wnskc4dgQeznjgZupAQsMFjERI">see explanation</a>). Be sure to talk about as many of the bulleted items
            above as possible. Also, include some conclusions about what makes for good web design. Your writing will be evaluated for quality, so use your best writing. <br>
          </li>
          <li> Submit the  slides and the written critique to
            me in Google Classroom, in &ldquo;Project 2: Evaluating Web Site Design.&rdquo; </li>
          <li> Your choice of sites is up to you. However, as with
            everything else in the class, they must be school
            appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
