        <p>Transitions provide, among other things, a simple way to  &quot;animate&quot; some of your html elements.</p>
        <p>As you move the cursor around this page, you will notice that it flips lef-to-right. That is done with transitions.</p>
        <p>There are many tutorials on the internet about how to do cool things with CSS transitions.&nbsp; I've linked to one of these at the bottom of this page; feel free to find your own, if you prefer. In this project, you will write code for some of these. Find ones that are fairly easy; skip the hard ones.  </p>
        <p>Here is one example I found. It makes links that fade out when you are about to click on them. Annoying, but fun!&nbsp; You may try it if you like.</p>
        <h3>Mr. Young's &quot;Fade-away&quot; tutorial</h3>
        <p>Put this code in your CSS</p>
        <pre><code>a{
  transition-property: all;
  transition-duration: 350ms;
  transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  position: relative;
  background-color: white;
  color: black;
}
 
a:hover{
  top: -2px
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}
</code></pre>

        <p><strong>Then in the html have a hyperlink like this:</strong></p>
        


        <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br />
  &lt;html&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;head&gt;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &lt;title&gt;fade-on-hover transition&lt;/title&gt;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;link  rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&gt;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/head&gt;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;body&gt;<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility  on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices   and prepare the nation for a new age. - Barack Obama, 2009<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ul&gt;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brackets.io&quot;&gt;TRY CLICKING ON  THIS.&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &lt;/li&gt;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/ul&gt;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/body&gt;<br />
  &lt;/html&gt;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Another example: do you want to flip text left-to-right?</p>
        <pre><code>     div {
          transform:rotateY(180deg);
         }</code></pre>
          <p>For more complex animations, there are many tools available. <a href="https://www.google.com/webdesigner/">Google Web Designer.</a> sounds Like a good place to start</p>

        <h4>Use a layout table to show off a total of 4 ways of animating web elements.</h4>
        <p>I feel you need a topic to unify this project, which is otherwise just about using 'transitions.' Pick something you want to convince others of. Something you want to advocate. This is sometimes called 'writing a polemic.' Or it can be a straight-out advertisement, if you want. </p>
        <p>Check out <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/05/8-simple-css3-transitions-that-will-wow-your-users/">this site</a>. It contains  8 simple animations using CSS  transitions (mostly). Choose from among them or from examples in other internet articles you may find.<br />
        </p>
        <p>Do 4 animations and include them in the layout table on your page.</p>
