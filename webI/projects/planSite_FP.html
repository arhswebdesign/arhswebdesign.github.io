        <p>You may choose
          the subject of the site as long as it is school appropriate.
          However, you need to choose a subject category that is
          different from the work you have already done in class. For
          example, if you have already made some kind of music web site,
          you need to choose another topic. If you have done a sports
          web site, choose another topic. </p>
        <h4> The Audience:</h4>
        <p>
        Who is the audience for this site and what do they need to know that the web site can provide? Be specific and clear in your writing. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Here are some points to address:
        </p>
  
        <h5> Communicate to the Audience: the main purpose of the site</h5>
       
        <ul>
          <li>The reason the website exists</li>
          <li>Who are they?</li>
          <li> What is their age group?</li>
          <li>What are their special interests?</li>
          <li>What is their assumed prior knowledge?</li>
          <li>What does the audience need to know that the website will
            provide?</li>
          <li>How can the site design fit the audience?</li>
        </ul>

            (see 7 points, above), the <strong><em>website</em></strong>, and details of <em><strong>how the website is appropriate</strong></em> for the audience. Include a discussion of <em><strong>style choices</strong></em> and how they will work well for your audience.</li>
