<h4 class="assign">Assignment: Create a generic 
        website for a high school teacher to be used as a resource for his/her 
        classes. This should be a general teacher site. In other words it should 
        be adaptable to any teacher. Due Date: Tuesday, 11/10/09 </h4>
	<br />
      <p > <span id="bold">NOTE:</span> You may choose to use this assignment to 
        meet the community service requirement for this course. If that is the 
        case, then you need to inform me ahead of time and have the teacher contact 
        me with an email. The teacher will likely have his/her own requests for pages and links.</p>
	<br />
      <p ><span id="bold">The site should have 5 pages:</span> Home, Course Information,
        Homework, Resource Links, and a Calendar. The calendar should be a table 
        set up as a generic calendar that can easily be changed depending on the 
        month.</p>
