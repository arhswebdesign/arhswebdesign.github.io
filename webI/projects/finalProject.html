        <p>Keeping in mind our discussions of good web design, create a
          web site. This will be an example of your

        <h3> Creating the web site:
        </h3>

        <h4> General requirements for the site:
        </h4>
        <p>It is wise to have all pages in your site share a consistent style.</p>
        <p>This means that you will save typing if you make one of the pages nearly complete before starting on the others. Do as much styling as you can, and put the style rules into an external style sheet.</p>
        <p>Then you can copy that first page, and use it as a starting point for each of the other pages in the site.</p>
        <p>Just change the content.</p>
        <p>Since it has a link to the external style sheet, you will continue to get the same style on all the pages.</p>
        <p>The starting place for your users is the file named index.html. The others can have any name you choose, although it must end in ".html" and it is best to use underscore rather than spaces, so "page_two.html" is better than "page two.html".</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Use a carefully-structured layout to organize each page. You can do this with tables, as we have been, but you can use other methods, such as the CSS-only "box model" method.</li>
          <li>Give each page a unique title, in the &lt;title&gt; tag.</li>
          <li>Use an external style sheet to style all pages in the site.</li>
          <li>Be sure all links work.</li>
          <li>The site should contain at least 4 pages. </li>
          <li>Include alternate text for all images.</li>
          <li>Each of the pages must have a link to all of the others. Navigation should be easily accessible and simple to
            manage. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp">One example</a> and <a href="active_class_clearest.html">my own, even simpler version</a>.</li>
            <li>Indent and arrange your <a href="https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/html-css-style-guide-students#general-formatting-rules">html</a> and <a href="https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/html-css-style-guide-students#block-content-indentation">CSS</a> code so that it is easy to read.</li>
          <li> Indicate on the home page who designed the site.</li>
          <li>Include <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_comment">html code comments</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_syntax2">CSS code comments</a> to explain what  you are doing in each section of your code.</li>
          <li> Cite
              all work that you are using that is not yours. For
              example, you may quote information from another source,
              but you need to give a citation for that source to give
              the creator credit. This includes written and visual work. <a
href="../general/resources.html#citing">Visit and read the "Citing Sources" links.</a> Here's an <a href="../examples/hairs.html">example</a> of how I do citations on my own web pages.</li>
        </ul>          
        <p> Have someone else review your site as you are working on
            it to see what the audience response may be.</p>
        <p> Check the site thoroughly before submitting it to be sure
            links work, words are spelled correctly, credit is given,
            etc.</p>
        <p> Any questions? Please ask.<br>
