        <h4 class="assign">Assignment: Create a website of your choice. </h4>
        <h4 class="assign">plans for This project are due Due Wednesday, 1/8/20</h4>
        <h4 class="assign">Due Date: Due at noon on Thursday, 1/16/20</h4>
        <p>Keeping in mind our discussions of good web design, create a
          web site. This will be an example of your
          best work as web designers. Put all of the skills you have
          learned and developed this semester into this project. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The site should be at least 4-5 pages deep. You may choose
          the subject of the site as long as it is school appropriate.
          However, you need to choose a subject category that is
          different from the work you have already done in class. For
          example, if you have already made some kind of music web site,
          you need to choose another topic. If you have done a sports
          web site, choose another topic. </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Complete the planning assignment before beginning the
            actual site construction.</li>
          <li>Make a fully styled &amp; designed <strong>template</strong> with external style sheet before building your first page.            This saves typing, because you can start with a copy of this template for each of the pages in the site</li>
          <li>Organize all files for this site into its own folder. </li>
          <li>Create an images folder in the website folder and put all
            images in it.</li>
          <li>Name the &quot;home&quot; page 
          index.html.</li>
          <li>Give each page a unique  &lt;title&gt; tag.</li>
          <li>Include alternate text for all images.</li>
          <li>Navigation should be easily accessible and simple to
            manage.</li>
          <li>Organize your html code so that it is easy to read.</li>
          <li> Give all files meaningful names. For example: “Paintings”
            is meaningful, but “new page 4” is not. “Facts” is
            meaningful but “untitled” is not.</li>
          <li>Use external style sheet/s to set the style for the
            website.</li>
          <li> Use tables to help layout the pages. Laying out the pages
            with CSS is an alternative to using tables for layout.</li>
          <li> Make sure all links work, and that <em>relative</em> pathnames for
            the links are used except for links to the internet.</li>
          <li> Indicate on the home page who designed the site.</li>
          <li> Comment the code thoroughly</li>
          <li> <a
href="../general/resources.html">Cite
              all work that you are using that is not yours. For
              example, you may quote information from another source,
              but you need to give a citation for that source to give
              the creator credit. This includes written and visual work.</a></li>
          <li> Have someone else review your site as you are working on
            it to see what the audience response may be.</li>
          <li> Check the site thoroughly before submitting it to be sure
            links work, words are spelled correctly, credit is given,
            etc.</li>
          <li> Any questions? Please ask.<br>
