        <p>Keeping in mind our discussions of good web design, create a
          web site. This will be an example of your
          best work as web designers. Put all of the skills you have
          learned and developed this term into this project. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The site should contain at least 4 pages. </p>
        <br>

        <p><span id="bold">Requirements for this website</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete the planning assignment before beginning the
            actual site construction.</li>
          <li>Make a fully styled &amp; designed <strong>template</strong> with external style sheet before building your first page.            This saves typing, because you can start with a copy of this template for each of the pages in the site</li>
          <li>Organize all files for this site into its own folder. </li>
          <li>Create an images folder in the website folder and put all
            images in it.</li>
          <li>Name the &quot;home&quot; page 
          index.html.</li>
          <li>Give each page a unique  &lt;title&gt; tag.</li>
          <li>Include alternate text for all images.</li>
          <li>Navigation should be easily accessible and simple to
            manage.</li>
          <li>Organize your html code so that it is easy to read.</li>
          <li> Give all files meaningful names. For example: “Paintings”
            is meaningful, but “new page 4” is not. “Facts” is
            meaningful but “untitled” is not.</li>
          <li>Use external style sheet/s to set the style for the
            website.</li>
          <li> Use tables to help layout the pages. Laying out the pages
            with CSS is an alternative to using tables for layout.</li>
          <li> Make sure all links work, and that <em>relative</em> pathnames for
            the links are used except for links to the internet.</li>
          <li> Indicate on the home page who designed the site.</li>
          <li> Comment the code thoroughly</li>
          <li> <a
href="../general/resources.html">Cite
              all work that you are using that is not yours. For
              example, you may quote information from another source,
              but you need to give a citation for that source to give
              the creator credit. This includes written and visual work.</a></li>
          <li> Have someone else review your site as you are working on
            it to see what the audience response may be.</li>
          <li> Check the site thoroughly before submitting it to be sure
            links work, words are spelled correctly, credit is given,
            etc.</li>
          <li> Any questions? Please ask.<br>
