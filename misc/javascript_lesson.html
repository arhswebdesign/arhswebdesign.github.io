<p>JavaScript is more difficult to learn than other Web Fundamentals such as HTML and CSS. Before delving into this lesson, please be sure that you are familiar with these and can use them properly.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. It is used to make dynamic webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Activity 1</strong></p>
<p>Please follow all of the listed steps, here you will be learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedded API's</li>
<li>How JS works under the hood.</li>
<li>JavaScript code order</li>
<li>Client-Side vs. Server-Side</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript"><em>Assignment 1</em></a></p>
<p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Please create an html page with a button showing text saying some text other than what is provided.</li>
<li>Make it so that when you click this button, a heading appears underneath the button saying some other text other than what was added above.</li>
<li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: This should be similar to the example code, just with some simple modifications and the comments put in your own words.</p>
<p>Save both the html file and the javascript file as: '1_1.html' and '1_1.js' accordingly.</p>
<p>You will be submitting these exercises.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash"><em>Assignment 2</em></a></p>
<p>By this time you should have a good understanding of JS theory as well as simple idea of how it can interact with html.</p>
<p>In this next step, we will be learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li>More examples of JS code</li>
<li>How to think about problems</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Loops</li>
</ul>
<p>This page may seem somewhat long, but it provides really essential content to learn javascript. When you have finished you will have a good grasp on the simple technical aspects of JS necessary to start building more feature-filled applications.</p>
<p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Please build the game that the instructions provide.</li>
<li>Style the paragraph in whatever capacity you like</li>
<li>Change the values to display what you would like.</li>
<li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">Developer Tools</a> are useful here. In short, developer tools allow you to inspect the DOM provided by whichever webpage you are accessing the content of. They also have an integrated console that responds with errors if the code that you provide to it is incorrect, and a debugger to step through your code to understand where it is proceeding incorrectly. It also provides an integrated javascript shell to interact with to test small functions.<br />To access this feature, you can right click on any webpage and select 'inspect'. You can also type 'Ctrl+Shift+I' on windows, or 'Command+Option+I' on Mac to immediately open the tools.</p>
<p>Save the html file containing the javascript as: '1_2.html'.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong"><em>Assignment 3</em></a></p>
<p>In this next step, we will be learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Errors</li>
</ul>
<p>When encountering errors you'll know what the types of errors you are receiving as well as where to turn to after receiving them.</p>
<p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Please follow what is said</li>
<li>Write in a p tag what the difference between syntax and logic errors is.</li>
<li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, you encounter errors often when programming. Creating code that does precisely what you'd like to do is difficult, because it's difficult to communicate explicitly what your intentions are in any given system. Errors help point you toward faults in your logic that are preventing you from communicating your ideas properly to the computer.</p>
<p>Note: In general with most errors, if you copy the stack trace and put it in google you can most often reason your way out of it. As mentioned before, if you see that your code is returning a bizzare error in your developer tools- you can copy the code returned and paste it into google. Most of the time, people have encountered your problem before and fixing it only relies on simple reasoning.</p>
<p>Save the html file containing the javascript as: '1_3.html'.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables"><em>Assignment 4</em></a></p>
<p>In this next step, we will be learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Variable Types</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Within a javascript file, create an example of a number variable, a string variable, an expression, an array, and an object.</li>
<li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most simple building block of any language is the variable. Understanding them is essential for moving forward in programming.</p>
<p>Note: In general with most errors, if you copy the stack trace and put it in google you can most often reason your way out of it.</p>
<p>Save the html file containing the javascript as: '1_4.js'.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math"><em>Assignment 5</em></a></p>
<p>In this next step, we will be learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operators (Comparison, Increment)</li>
<li>Simple Math</li>
</ul>
<p>Math is used often in programming, so it's details are useful to know. Regardless of your opinion of it, it is the cornerstone of the calculation based processes that run our world.</p>
<p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a text element that changes it's text back and forth based on a boolean variable triggered by a button click.</li>
<li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
</ol>
<p>Save the file(s) with the prefix '1_5'.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings"><em>Assignment 6</em></a></p>
<p>In this next step, we will be learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strings!</li>
</ul>
<p>Strings are what text is called in programming. This is the essential technology that we use to communicate, and the web is a largely text-based medium. Therefore it is truly essential that we have control over the words within this system. Almost all programs use text in some form.</p>
<p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create an input dialog that asks for your favorite color and returns 'my favorite color is blue as well!' if the response returned is the string 'blue'.</li>
<li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
</ol>
<p>Save the file(s) with the prefix '1_6'.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Useful_string_methods"><em>Assignment 7</em></a></p>
<p>In this next step, we will be learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li>String Methods!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the concept of strings have been introduced, it is important to understand the useful operations that can be accomplished with them and how they allow you to do powerful things in the context of a program.</p>
<p>Following the instructions provided within the link...</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create an input dialog that returns the input with the added suffix &quot;cious&quot; and makes the input in all capital and returns this as a header.</li>
<li>Please add a comment to explain what is happening in your own words.</li>
</ol>
<p>Save the file(s) with the prefix '1_7'.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays"><em>Assignment 8</em></a></p>
<p>In this next step, we will be learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrays</li>
</ul>
<p>These are a simple way of storing a list of data items under a single variable name. We will then be creating them and manipulating them and seeing how that is useful in the context of larger programs.</p>
<p>Complete the application provided in the instructions.</p>
<p>Save the file(s) with the prefix '1_8'.</p>
