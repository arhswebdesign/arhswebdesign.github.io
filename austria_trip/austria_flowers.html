    <h2>Introduction </h2>
    <p>There are many beautiful places to visit in the Alps.</p>
    <h2>For example, just south of Halstatt the Hoher Dachstein rises to 2,995 m (9,826 ft) </h2>

      <h4>Wildflowers you might see:</h4>
      <p>Much-loved representatives of the species Gentian in garden culture include the group of Stemless Gentian which, in popular opinion, are not distinguishable from each other, but at least 6 different species are distinguished by the botanist. The Broad-leafed Gentian (Gentiana acaulis)is always found on acid soil.From its pale green leaf rosette the stemless, dark blue bell flowers grow to a height of 6 cm. The similar Clusius’ Enzian (Gentiana clusii) is distinguished by its spiked leaves and calyx and beyond that prefers lime soil. Both species spread from the Pyrenees to the Alps and the Carpatian mountains to an altitude of 3000 metres. The flowers of both species are erroneously depicted on the labels on Gentian schnapps bottles. The original, rare schnapps is made from the tall Yellow Gentian, where about 100 kilos of root are required for one litre of schnapps. Due to unchecked uprooting and plucking, but in particular through the use of chemical/artificial fertilizers it has become rare or even extinct in some regions.
This also applies to the well-known Spring Gentian (Gentiana verna) and at least three similar hardly distinguishable species popularly termed Cobbler's Nail (“Schusternagele”). The deep blue star-shaped flowers of the Spring Gentian stand up to 10 cm above the ground level leaf rosette. It inhabits scree and patchy meadows on chalk up to 2900 metres above sea level. The somewhat smaller Short-Leaved Gentian (Gentiana brachyphylla) grows on poor chalk soils, particularly in the Central Alps. Particularly in autumn we find similar but densely flowering, red violet coloured gentians in the Alps. All of these are very short-lived and frequently only annual, which on the whole is very rare among alpine plants. Nearly all these small species close their flowers during cold or cloudy weather.<br>
