        Site Design Assignment </h4>
      <p>This assignment supports our investigation of good and bad design of 
        web sites. Your task will be to critique at least two sites using the 
        handout on web design criteria. Check out this page that explains these 
        criteria in detail,criteria explanation. One of the sites that you will 
        evaluate will be an example of good design and the other an example of 
        bad design. You may evaluate more than two sites if you like.</p>
      <p>To critique something is to analyze it closely and carefully. This is 
        not necessarily a negative analysis. There may be some positive and some 
        negative qualities a site has, but you do need to eventually take a stand 
        and state that the web site works well or does not, based on the overall 
        assessment of it. In this process you will be responsible for closely 
        examining the qualities of the web sites. Using the Web Design Criteria 
        handout, look at the web sites in terms of the three major areas of Content, 
        Organization and Appearance, and more specifically in terms of the categories 
        within each major area. Use the Web Design Evaluation Checklist to keep 
        a record of your evaluation. Use this as your notes when preparing your 
        presentation and the written evaluation.</p>
      <p>You will present your findings to in a small group. Guide the group through 
        your evaluation and point out the parts of the web site that make it a 
        good or bad design. </p>
      <p>Create 3 powerpoint slides to organize your ideas. Use the slides in 
        your presetation.</p>
      <p>Write a 1-2 page critique of web design using the two studied sites as 
        the focus of your analysis. </p>
      <p>Submit the powerpoint slides and the written critique to me as attachments 
        via email. Writing standards for any academic writing will be used to 
        evaluate the writing.</p>
      <p>The sites are open to your choice. However, as with everything else in 
        the class, they must be school appropriate.</p></td>
