<p>Welcome to the International Imperialism Museum Help Center! The museum is 
  an interactive way for students to learn about imperialism in America&#8217;s 
  history. The student&#8217;s objective in the Imperialism Museum is to create 
  web pages about their assigned country within a template which will be used 
  for the entire museum. </p>
<h3>How to Create Your Pages:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Open Microsoft Frontpage, a web design program which will turn your text into HTML 
    code for the website. </li>
  <li>Type you information as you would type any assignment. A title has already 
    been put on your site, so just jump right in with content. Feel free to use 
    images and bulleted lists (The button to start one is on the toolbar at the 
    bottom). You will see that there are buttons on the screen toolbars which 
    will allow you to insert these things similarly to how you would in Microsoft 
    Word.</li>
  <li> Please Note: Do not format your text with fonts, colors, sizes, etc! When 
    your content is added to the Museum Site, it will magically be formatted to 
    become a stylish, matching edition to the site. Your words will have a nice 
    color and font, your pictures will have borders, your paragraphs will be indented, 
    etc. If you want, underlines, italics, and bolded text are OK. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Inserting Images:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Inserting images is a three step process. First find an image online that 
    you would like to incorporate into your site. Right-click it and save it in 
    the Shared Folder (G:) under Student &gt; Fricke &gt; images. (If you are 
    not in Mr. Fricke&#8217;s Class, you might be using a different folder, your 
    teacher should let you know.) Remember to give your image a short but descriptive 
    name so that you will be able to find it. </li>
  <li>Click the insert image button and navigate your way to your image through 
    the shared folder. The insert image button looks like a sun setting over mountains.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating Code</h3>
<ul>
  <li> When all of your information has been added, check over it carefully&#8230; 
    you will not want to have to change anything once it has been HTML-icized. 
  </li>
  <li>When you are really sure that your group is finished, click the View menu 
    at the top of the screen and select the option of viewing Text and Code. Don&#8217;t 
    be intimidated, you won&#8217;t have to do much with the code, basically just 
    copying and pasting:<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Copy and Paste Code into the Site </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Highlight the code between the purple "body" tags. Make 
    sure that you get the whole first line of your code (the program tends to 
    hide the very beginning of the lines.) </li>
  <li>Continue to highlight down to the other purple "body" tag. Copy this 
    selection (you can do this with Ctrl-C).</li>
  <li> On the desktop, click the shortcut to &#8220;My Computer&#8221;. Navigate 
    to the (G:) Drive ? Student ? Fricke and you&#8217;ll see a list of web-pages 
    with the Internet Explorer logo. Find the one that you just wrote text for. 
    For example, if you just made a page about the critics of Imperialism in Panama, 
    you would choose &#8220;panama_anti.&#8221; </li>
  <li>Double click the page to open it. Right click somewhere on the page and 
    select &#8220;View Source.&#8221; A notepad document will open. Scroll through 
    until you find the area marked &#8220;Insert your Dreamweaver Code.&#8221; 
    It&#8217;s a good way down the page, but it will be easy to spot. </li>
  <li>Paste your code, you can use Ctrl-V</li>
  <li> Now all that&#8217;s left is to save the Notepad document you just edited. 
    When this is done, return to your webpage, and click refresh. </li>
  <li>You should see your work seamlessly integrated into the Imperialism Museum. </p> 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This process was designed to be as simple as possible, but part of Web Design 
  is trouble-shooting. If something goes wrong with your page, please don&#8217;t 
  panic. Ask your teacher or someone experienced in web design for help. Also, 
  it never hurts to read the directions again, just in case you missed something. 
</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy working with the International Imperialism Museum!</p>
